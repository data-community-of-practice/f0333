AB  - Encouraged by the success of pretrained Transformer models in many natural language processing tasks, their use for International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding tasks is now actively being explored. In this study, we investigated two existing Transformer-based models (PLM-ICD and XR-Transformer) and proposed a novel Transformer-based model (XR-LAT), aiming to address the extreme label set and long text classification challenges that are posed by automated ICD coding tasks. The Transformer-based model PLM-ICD, which currently holds the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the ICD coding benchmark datasets MIMIC-III and MIMIC-II, was selected as our baseline model for further optimisation on both datasets. In addition, we extended the capabilities of the leading model in the general extreme multi-label text classification domain, XR-Transformer, to support longer sequences and trained it on both datasets. Moreover, we proposed a novel model, XR-LAT, which was also trained on both datasets. XR-LAT is a recursively trained model chain on a predefined hierarchical code tree with label-wise attention, knowledge transferring and dynamic negative sampling mechanisms. Our optimised PLM-ICD models, which were trained with longer total and chunk sequence lengths, significantly outperformed the current SOTA PLM-ICD models, and achieved the highest micro-F1 scores of 60.8 % and 50.9 % on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-II, respectively. The XR-Transformer model, although SOTA in the general domain, did not perform well across all metrics. The best XR-LAT based models obtained results that were competitive with the current SOTA PLM-ICD models, including improving the macro-AUC by 2.1 % and 5.1 % on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-II, respectively. Our optimised PLM-ICD models are the new SOTA models for automated ICD coding on both datasets, while our novel XR-LAT models perform competitively with the previous SOTA PLM-ICD models.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accurate coding is critical for medical billing and electronic medical record (EMR)-based research. Recent research has been focused on developing supervised methods to automatically assign International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from clinical notes. However, supervised approaches rely on ICD code data stored in the hospital EMR system and is subject to bias rising from the practice and coding behavior. Consequently, portability of trained supervised algorithms to external EMR systems may suffer. METHOD: We developed an unsupervised knowledge integration (UNITE) algorithm to automatically assign ICD codes for a specific disease by analyzing clinical narrative notes via semantic relevance assessment. The algorithm was validated using coded ICD data for 6 diseases from Partners HealthCare (PHS) Biobank and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III). We compared the performance of UNITE against penalized logistic regression (LR), topic modeling, and neural network models within each EMR system. We additionally evaluated the portability of UNITE by training at PHS Biobank and validating at MIMIC-III, and vice versa. RESULTS: UNITE achieved an averaged AUC of 0.91 at PHS and 0.92 at MIMIC over 6 diseases, comparable to LR and MLP. It had substantially better performance than topic models. In regards to portability, the performance of UNITE was consistent across different EMR systems, superior to LR, topic models and neural network models. CONCLUSION: UNITE accurately assigns ICD code in EMR without requiring human labor, and has major advantages over commonly used machine learning approaches. In addition, the UNITE attained stable performance and high portability across EMRs in different institutions.

AB  - The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) is one of the widely used classification system for diagnoses and procedures to assign diagnosis codes to Electronic Health Record (EHR) associated with a patient's stay. The aim of this paper is to propose an automated coding system to assist physicians in the assignment of ICD codes to EHR. For this purpose, we created a pipeline of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL) models able to extract the useful information from French medical texts and to perform classification. After the evaluation phase, our approach was able to predict 346 diagnosis codes from heterogeneous medical units with an accuracy average of 83%. Our results were finally validated by physicians of the Medical Information Department (MID) in charge of coding hospital stays.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computer-assisted clinical coding (CAC) based on automated coding algorithms has been expected to improve the International Classification of Disease, tenth version (ICD-10) coding quality and productivity, whereas studies oriented to primary diagnosis auto-coding are limited in the Chinese context. OBJECTIVE: This study aims at developing a machine learning (ML) model for automated primary diagnosis ICD-10 coding. METHODS: A total of 71,709 admissions in Fuwai hospital were included to carry out this study, corresponding to 168 primary diagnosis ICD-10 codes. Based on clinical implications, two feature engineering methods were used to process discharge diagnosis and procedure texts into sequential features and sequential grouping features respectively by which two kinds of models were built and compared. One baseline model using one-hot encoding features was considered. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) was adopted as the classifier, and grid search and cross-validation were used to select the optimal hyperparameters. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were applied to give the interpretability of models. RESULTS: Our best prediction model was developed based on sequential grouping features. It showed good performance in the test phase with accuracy and macro-averaged F1 (Macro-F1) of 95.2% and 88.3% respectively. The comparison of the models demonstrated the effectiveness of the sequential information and the grouping strategy in boosting model performance (P-value < 0.01). Subgroup analysis of the best model on each individual code manifested that 91.1% of the codes achieved the F1 over 70.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Our model has been demonstrated its effectiveness for automated primary diagnosis coding in the Chinese context and its results are interpretable. Hence, it has the potential to assist clinical coders to improve coding efficiency and quality in Chinese inpatient settings.

AB  - Automated ICD coding via machine learning that focuses on some specific diseases has been a hot topic. As one of the leading causes of death, coronary heart diseases (CHD) have seldom been specifically studied by related research, probably due to lack of data concretely targeting at the diseases. Based on Fuwai-CHD and MIMIC-III-CHD, which are a private dataset from Fuwai Hospital and the CHD-related subset of a public dataset named MIMIC-III respectively, this study aimed at automated CHD coding by a deep learning method, which mainly consists of three modules.

AB  - ICD-9 (the Ninth Revision of International Classification of Diseases) is widely used to describe a patient's diagnosis. Accurate automated ICD-9 coding is important because manual coding is expensive, time-consuming, and inefficient. Inspired by the recent successes of deep learning, in this study, we present a deep learning framework called DeepLabeler to automatically assign ICD-9 codes. DeepLabeler combines the convolutional neural network with the 'Document to Vector' technique to extract and encode local and global features. Our proposed DeepLabeler demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance, i.e., 0.335 micro F-measure on MIMIC-II dataset and 0.408 micro F-measure on MIMIC-III dataset. It outperforms classical hierarchy-based SVM and flat-SVM both on these two datasets by at least 14 percent. Furthermore, we analyze the deep neural network structure to discover the vital elements in the success of DeepLabeler. We find that the convolutional neural network is the most effective component in our network and the 'Document to Vector' technique is also necessary for enhancing classification performance since it extracts well-recognized global features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the great promise of deep learning techniques in the field of text multi-label classification and automated medical coding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Automated ICD coding on medical texts via machine learning has been a hot topic. Related studies from medical field heavily relies on conventional bag-of-words (BoW) as the feature extraction method, and do not commonly use more complicated methods, such as word2vec (W2V) and large pretrained models like BERT. This study aimed at uncovering the most effective feature extraction methods for coding models by comparing BoW, W2V and BERT variants. METHODS: We experimented with a Chinese dataset from Fuwai Hospital, which contains 6947 records and 1532 unique ICD codes, and a public Spanish dataset, which contains 1000 records and 2557 unique ICD codes. We designed coding tasks with different code frequency thresholds (denoted as [Formula: see text]), with a lower threshold indicating a more complex task. Using traditional classifiers, we compared BoW, W2V and BERT variants on accomplishing these coding tasks. RESULTS: When [Formula: see text] was equal to or greater than 140 for Fuwai dataset, and 60 for the Spanish dataset, the BERT variants with the whole network fine-tuned was the best method, leading to a Micro-F1 of 93.9% for Fuwai data when [Formula: see text], and a Micro-F1 of 85.41% for the Spanish dataset when [Formula: see text]. When [Formula: see text] fell below 140 for Fuwai dataset, and 60 for the Spanish dataset, BoW turned out to be the best, leading to a Micro-F1 of 83% for Fuwai dataset when [Formula: see text], and a Micro-F1 of 39.1% for the Spanish dataset when [Formula: see text]. Our experiments also showed that both the BERT variants and BoW possessed good interpretability, which is important for medical applications of coding models. CONCLUSIONS: This study shed light on building promising machine learning models for automated ICD coding by revealing the most effective feature extraction methods. Concretely, our results indicated that fine-tuning the whole network of the BERT variants was the optimal method for tasks covering only frequent codes, especially codes that represented unspecified diseases, while BoW was the best for tasks involving both frequent and infrequent codes. The frequency threshold where the best-performing method varied differed between different datasets due to factors like language and codeset.

AB  - Automated ICD coding is a multi-label prediction task aiming at assigning patient diagnoses with the most relevant subsets of disease codes. In the deep learning regime, recent works have suffered from large label set and heavy imbalance distribution. To mitigate the negative effect in such scenarios, we propose a retrieve and rerank framework that introduces the Contrastive Learning (CL) for label retrieval, allowing the model to make more accurate prediction from a simplified label space. Given the appealing discriminative power of CL, we adopt it as the training strategy to replace the standard cross-entropy objective and retrieve a small subset by taking the distance between clinical notes and ICD codes into account. After properly training, the retriever could implicitly capture the code co-occurrence, which makes up for the deficiency of cross-entropy assigning each label independently of the others. Further, we evolve a powerful model via a Transformer variant for refining and reranking the candidate set, which can extract semantically meaningful features from long clinical sequences. Applying our method on well-known models, experiments show that our framework provides more accurate results guaranteed by preselecting a small subset of candidates before fine-level reranking. Relying on the framework, our proposed model achieves 0.590 and 0.990 in terms of Micro-F1 and Micro-AUC on benchmark MIMIC-III.

AB  - The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a widely used criterion for disease classification, health monitoring, and medical data analysis. Deep learning-based automated ICD coding has gained attention due to the time-consuming and costly nature of manual coding. The main challenges of automated ICD coding include imbalanced label distribution, code hierarchy and noisy texts. Recent works have considered using code hierarchy or description for better label representation to solve the problem of imbalanced label distribution. However, these methods are still ineffective and redundant since they only interact with a constant label representation. In this work, we introduce a novel Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network with Contrastive Learning (HGCN-CL) to solve the above problems and the shortcomings of the previous methods. We adopt a Hyperbolic graph convolutional network on ICD coding to capture the hierarchical structure of codes, which can solve the problem of large distortions when embedding hierarchical structure with graph convolutional network. Besides, we introduce contrastive learning for automatic ICD coding by injecting code features into text encoder to generate hierarchical-aware positive samples to solve the problem of interacting with constant code features. We conduct experiments on the public MIMIC-III and MIMIC-II datasets. The results on MIMIC III show that HGCN-CL outperforms previous state-of-art methods for automatic ICD coding, which achieves a 2.7% and 3.6% improvement respectively compared to previous best results (Hypercore). We also provide ablation experiments and hierarchy visualization to verify the effectiveness of components in our model.

AB  - The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which is endorsed by the World Health Organization, is a diagnostic classification standard. ICD codes store, retrieve, and analyze health information to make clinical decisions. Currently, ICD coding has been adopted by more than 137 countries. However, in Pakistan, very few hospitals have implemented ICD coding and conducted different epidemiological studies. Moreover, none of them have reported the spectrum of liver disease burden based on ICD coding, nor implemented automated ICD coding. In this study, we annotated ICD codes for the database of the liver transplant unit of the Pir Abdul Qadir Shah Jeelani Institute of Medical Sciences. We named this database Medical Information Mart for Liver Transplantation (MIMLT). The results revealed that the database contains 34 ICD codes, of which V70.8 is the most frequent code. Furthermore, we determined the spectrum of liver disease burden in liver recipients based on ICD coding. We found that chronic hepatitis C (070.54) is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation. Additionally, we implemented automated ICD coding utilizing the MIMLT database and proposed a novel Deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network with Transfer Learning through pre-trained Embeddings (DRCNN

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop an unbiased objective for learning automatic coding algorithms from clinical records annotated with only partial relevant International Classification of Diseases codes, as annotation noise in undercoded clinical records used as training data can mislead the learning process of deep neural networks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III as our dataset. We employ positive-unlabeled learning to achieve unbiased loss estimation, which is free of misleading training signal. We then utilize reweighting mechanism to compensate for the imbalance between positive and negative samples. To further close the performance gap caused by poor quality annotation, we integrate the supervision provided by the automatic annotation tool Medical Concept Annotation Toolkit which can ease the heavy burden of manual validation. RESULTS: Our benchmarking results show that positive-unlabeled learning with reweighting outperforms competitive baseline methods over a range of missing label ratios. Integrating supervision provided by annotation tool further boosted the performance. DISCUSSION: Considering the annotation noise and severe imbalance, unbiased loss estimation and reweighting mechanism are both important for learning from undercoded clinical records. Unbiased loss requires the estimation of false negative ratios and estimation through trained models is practical and competitive. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of positive-unlabeled learning with reweighting and supervision provided by the annotation tool is a promising solution to learn from undercoded clinical records.

AB  - Effective public health surveillance requires consistent monitoring of disease signals such that researchers and decision-makers can react dynamically to changes in disease occurrence. However, whilst surveillance initiatives exist in production animal veterinary medicine, comparable frameworks for companion animals are lacking. First-opinion veterinary electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to reveal disease signals and often represent the initial reporting of clinical syndromes in animals presenting for medical attention, highlighting their possible significance in early disease detection. Yet despite their availability, there are limitations surrounding their free text-based nature, inhibiting the ability for national-level mortality and morbidity statistics to occur. This paper presents PetBERT, a large language model trained on over 500 million words from 5.1 million EHRs across the UK. PetBERT-ICD is the additional training of PetBERT as a multi-label classifier for the automated coding of veterinary clinical EHRs with the International Classification of Disease 11 framework, achieving F1 scores exceeding 83% across 20 disease codings with minimal annotations. PetBERT-ICD effectively identifies disease outbreaks, outperforming current clinician-assigned point-of-care labelling strategies up to 3 weeks earlier. The potential for PetBERT-ICD to enhance disease surveillance in veterinary medicine represents a promising avenue for advancing animal health and improving public health outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current digital medical databases record systematically coded diagnoses, but many legacy databases are full of hand-written, free text diagnoses, which can only be meaningfully analysed after mapping them to a coding system. While diagnoses can be extracted from full medical notes with good accuracy, no algorithm using only an unstructured free text diagnosis with no additional data has been published to date. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: Therefore, we sought to create an algorithm which maps hand-written German diagnoses from our clinical photography database to ICD-10 diagnosis codes, validate its output manually by dermatologists and analyse diagnosis counts over time as a proof-of-concept of its application. RESULTS: Our rule-based algorithm mapped 50,884 unprocessed hand-written German free-text diagnoses covering five decades to ICD-10 codes, while reaching an accuracy of 82% against 817 dermatologist-validated diagnoses. Out of 41,021 data points with the highest algorithm confidence the top 3 identified diagnosis classes were psoriasis, eczema, and non-melanoma skin cancer. The number of ICD-10 codes belonging to chronic inflammatory diseases showed a seasonal pattern with peaks in July, and when analysed aggregated by year, peaks correlated to events such as new therapy classes for these diseases. CONCLUSION: Using the presented algorithm, it is possible to reliably match hand-written free text of German dermatological diagnoses to ICD-10 codes, thus enabling systematic analysis of legacy databases, making past medical knowledge accessible to today's patient care.

AB  - The national teleconsultation platform Qare offers a promising tool to collect data in primary care by sharing the same EHR among teleconsultants. Conclusions for every teleconsultation are thus collected by a text using an ICD10 code or not. Nevertheless, the use of the ICD10 classification by primary care doctors is scarce. We developed an algorithm based on bags of words that associates an ICD10 code for each textual conclusion and evaluated it. It shows good performances (88 to 89% concordance) to assign ICD10 category. It could be used to enhance the volume of coded teleconsultations ready to be reused.

AB  - An electronic medical record (EMR) is a rich source of clinical information for medical studies. Each physician usually has his or her own way to describe a patient's diagnosis. This results in many different ways to describe the same disease, which produces a large number of informal nonstandard diagnoses in EMRs. The Tenth Revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) is a medical classification list of codes for diagnoses. Automated ICD-10 code assignment of the nonstandard diagnosis is an important way to improve the quality of the medical study. However, manual coding is expensive, time-consuming and inefficient. Moreover, terminology in the standard diagnostic library comprises approximately 23,000 subcategory (6-digit) codes. Classifying the entire set of subcategory codes is extremely challenging. ICD-10 codes in the standard diagnostic library are organized hierarchically, and each category code (3-digit) relates to several or dozens of subcategory (6-digit) codes. Based on the hierarchical structure of the ICD-10 code, we propose a two-stage ICD-10 code assignment framework, which examines the entire category codes (approximately 1900) and searches the subcategory codes under the specific category code. Furthermore, since medical coding datasets are plagued with a training data sparsity issue, we introduce more supervised information to overcome this issue. Compared with the method that searches within approximately 23,000 subcategory codes, our approach requires examination of a considerably reduced number of codes. Extensive experiments show that our framework can improve the performance of the automated code assignment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While potentially timesaving, there is no program to automatically transform diagnosis codes of the ICD-10 German modification (ICD-10-GM) into the injury severity score (ISS). OBJECTIVE: To develop a mapping method from ICD-10-GM into ICD-10 clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) to calculate the abbreviated injury scale (AIS) and ISS of each patient using the ICDPIC-R and to compare the manually and automatically calculated scores. METHODS: Between January 2019 and June 2021, the most severe AIS of each body region and the ISS were manually calculated using medical documentation and radiology reports of all major trauma patients of a German level I trauma centre. The ICD-10-GM codes of these patients were exported from the electronic medical data system SAP, and a Java program was written to transform these into ICD-10-CM codes. Afterwards, the ICDPIC-R was used to automatically generate the most severe AIS of each body region and the ISS. The automatically and manually determined ISS and AIS scores were then tested for equivalence. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that the manually and automatically calculated ISS were significantly equivalent over the entire patient cohort. Further sub-group analysis, however, showed that equivalence could only be demonstrated for patients with an ISS between 16 and 24. Likewise, the highest AIS scores of each body region were not equal in the manually and automatically calculated group. CONCLUSION: Though achieving mapping results highly comparable to previous mapping methods of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, it is not unrestrictedly possible to automatically calculate the AIS and ISS using ICD-10-GM codes.

AB  - The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) serves as a global healthcare administration standard, with one of its editions being ICD-10-CM, an enhanced diagnostic classification system featuring numerous new codes for specific anatomic sites, co-morbidities, and causes. These additions facilitate conveying the complexities of various diseases. Currently, ICD-10 coding is widely adopted worldwide. However, public hospitals in Pakistan have yet to implement it and automate the coding process. In this research, we implemented ICD-10-CM coding for a private database and named it Clinical Pool of Liver Transplant (CPLT). Additionally, we proposed a novel deep learning model called Deep Recurrent-Convolution Neural Network with a lambda-scaled Attention module (DRCNN-ATT) using the CPLT database to achieve automatic ICD-10-CM coding. DRCNN-ATT combines a bi-directional long short-term memory network (bi-LSTM), a multi-scale convolutional neural network (MS-CNN), and a lambda-scaled attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that deep recurrent convolutional neural network (DRCNN) faces attention score vanishing problem with a standard attention module for automatic ICD coding. However, adding a lambda-scaled attention module resolves this issue. We evaluated DRCNN-ATT model using two distinct datasets: a private CPLT dataset and a public MIMIC III top 50 dataset. The results indicate that the DRCNN-ATT model outperformed various baselines by generating 0.862 micro F1 and 0.25 macro F1 scores on CPLT dataset and 0.705 micro F1 and 0.655 macro F1 scores on MIMIC III top 50 dataset. Furthermore, we also deployed our model for automatic ICD-10-CM coding using ngrok and the Flask APIs, which receives input, processes it, and then returns the results.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Thai Modification (ICD-10-TM) ontology is a knowledge base created from the Thai modification of the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision. The objectives of this research were to develop the ICD-10-TM ontology as a knowledge base for use in a semi-automated ICD coding system and to test the usability of this system. METHODS: ICD concepts and relations were identified from a tabular list and alphabetical indexes. An ICD-10-TM ontology was defined in the resource description framework (RDF), notation-3 (N3) format. All ICD-10-TM contents available as Microsoft Word documents were transformed into N3 format using Python scripts. Final RDF files were validated by ICD experts. The ontology was implemented as a knowledge base by using a novel semi-automated ICD coding system. Evaluation of usability was performed by a survey of forty volunteer users. RESULTS: The ICD-10-TM ontology consists of two main knowledge bases (a tabular list knowledge base and an index knowledge base) containing a total of 309,985 concepts and 162,092 relations. The tabular list knowledge base can be divided into an upper level ontology, which defines hierarchical relationships between 22 ICD chapters, and a lower level ontology which defines relations between chapters, blocks, categories, rubrics and basic elements (include, exclude, synonym etc.) of the ICD tabular list. The index knowledge base describes relations between keywords, modifiers in general format and a table format of the ICD index. In this research, the creation of an ICD index ontology revealed interesting findings on problems with the current ICD index structure. One problem with the current structure is that it defines conditions that complicate pregnancy and perinatal conditions on the same hierarchical level as organ system diseases. This could mislead a coding algorithm into a wrong selection of ICD code. To prevent these coding errors by an algorithm, the ICD-10-TM index structure was modified by raising conditions complicating pregnancy and perinatal conditions into a higher hierarchical level of the index knowledge base. The modified ICD-10-TM ontology was implemented as a knowledge base in semi-automated ICD-10-TM coding software. A survey of users of the software revealed a high percentage of correct results obtained from ontology searches (>95%) and user satisfaction on the usability of the ontology. CONCLUSION: The ICD-10-TM ontology is the first ICD-10 ontology with a comprehensive description of all concepts and relations in an ICD-10-TM tabular list and alphabetical index. A researcher developing an automated ICD coding system should be aware of The ICD index structure and the complexity of coding processes. These coding systems are not a word matching process. ICD-10 ontology should be used as a knowledge base in The ICD coding software. It can be used to facilitate successful implementation of ICD in developing countries, especially in those countries which do not have an adequate number of competent ICD coders.

AB  - Automated diagnosis coding can be provided efficiently by learning predictive models from historical data; however, discriminating between thousands of codes while allowing a variable number of codes to be assigned is extremely difficult. Here, we explore various text representations and classification models for assigning ICD-9 codes to discharge summaries in MIMIC-III. It is shown that the relative effectiveness of the investigated representations depends on the frequency of the diagnosis code under consideration and that the best performance is obtained by combining models built using different representations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explores machine learning (ML) for automating unstructured textual data translation into structured International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes, aiming to identify algorithms that enhance mortality data accuracy and reliability for public health decisions. METHODS: This study analyzed death records from January 2017 to June 2022, sourced from Malaysia's Health Informatics Centre, coded into ICD-10. Data anonymization adhered to ethical standards, with 387,650 death registrations included after quality checks. The dataset, limited to three-digit ICD-10 codes, underwent cleaning and an 80:20 training-testing split. Preprocessing involved HTML tag removal and tokenization. ML approaches, including BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), Gzip+KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), TensorFlow, SVM (Support Vector Machine), and Naive Bayes, were evaluated for automated ICD-10 coding. Models were fine-tuned and assessed across accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, specificity, and precision-recall curves using Amazon SageMaker (Amazon Web Services, Seattle, WA). Sensitivity analysis addressed unbalanced data scenarios, enhancing model robustness. RESULTS: In assessing ICD-10 coding with ML, Gzip+KNN had the longest training time at 10 hours, with BERT leading in memory use. BERT performed best for the F1-score (0.71) and accuracy (0.82), closely followed by Gzip+KNN. TensorFlow excelled in recall, whereas SVM had the highest specificity but lower overall performance. XGBoost was notably less effective across metrics. Precision-recall analysis showed Gzip+KNN's superiority. On an unbalanced dataset, BERT and Gzip+KNN demonstrated consistent accuracy. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights that BERT and Gzip+KNN optimize ICD-10 coding, balancing efficiency, resource use, and accuracy. BERT excels in precision with higher memory demands, while Gzip+KNN offers robust accuracy and recall. This suggests significant potential for improving healthcare analytics and decision-making through advanced ML models.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The International Statistical Classification of Disease, 10 METHODS: The arthroplasty database at a single institution was retrospectively reviewed for all primary computer and robotic assisted THAs performed between October 2015 to November 2020. The type of technology utilized was determined from the surgical record and compared with the ICD-10-PCS codes applied to each procedure. RESULTS: A total of 3721 technology-assisted THAs were identified and reviewed. 87.5% of technology-assisted THAs were coded with the correct type of technology. The most common error in computer navigated THA was the omission of the technology code, while the most common error in robotic assisted THA was the designation of codes for both computer navigation and robotic assistance. CONCLUSION: The granular nature of ICD-10-PCS allows for precise distinction between types of technology-assisted THA. However, rates of coding inaccuracy bring concern for the integrity of this data. The inaccuracy of ICD-10-PCS data is not insignificant and should bring concern for the validity of collective data sets that use it exclusively for its procedural granularity.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have found a highly promising application in automated clinical coding (ACC), an innovation that will have profound impacts on the clinical coding industry, billing and revenue management, and potentially clinical care itself. Dong et al. recently analyzed the technical challenges of ACC and proposed future directions. Primary challenges for ACC exist at the technological and implementation levels; clinical documents are redundant and complex, code sets like the ICD-10 are rapidly evolving, training sets are not comprehensive of codes, and ACC models have yet to fully capture the logic and rules of coding decisions. Next steps include interdisciplinary collaboration with clinical coders, accessibility and transparency of datasets, and tailoring models to specific use cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recognition of medical entities from natural language is a ubiquitous problem in the medical field, with applications ranging from medical coding to the analysis of electronic health data for public health. It is, however, a complex task usually requiring human expert intervention, thus making it expansive and time-consuming. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, have enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems, with the notable example of neural sequence models and their powerful applications in natural language processing. However, they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. The Centre for Epidemiology on Medical Causes of Death (CépiDc) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of natural language examples provided with their associated human-coded medical entities available to the machine learning practitioner. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to investigate the application of deep neural sequence models to the problem of medical entity recognition from natural language. METHODS: The investigated data set included every French death certificate from 2011 to 2016. These certificates contain information such as the subject's age, the subject's gender, and the chain of events leading to his or her death, both in French and encoded as International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) medical entities, for a total of around 3 million observations in the data set. The task of automatically recognizing ICD-10 medical entities from the French natural language-based chain of events leading to death was then formulated as a type of predictive modeling problem known as a sequence-to-sequence modeling problem. A deep neural network-based model, known as the Transformer, was then slightly adapted and fit to the data set. Its performance was then assessed on an external data set and compared to the current state-of-the-art approach. CIs for derived measurements were estimated via bootstrapping. RESULTS: The proposed approach resulted in an F-measure value of 0.952 (95% CI 0.946-0.957), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art approach and its previously reported F-measure value of 0.825 as assessed on a comparable data set. Such an improvement makes possible a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level automated coding to temporal harmonization of death statistics. CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows that a deep artificial neural network can directly learn from voluminous data sets in order to identify complex relationships between natural language and medical entities, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived model constitutes a powerful tool for automated coding of medical entities from medical language with promising potential applications.

AB  - The ICD-10-GM coding system used in the German healthcare system only captures a minority of rare disease diagnoses. Therefore, information on the incidence and prevalence of rare diseases as well as necessary (financial) resources for the expert care required for evidence-based decisions by health insurers, care providers, and politicians are lacking. Furthermore, the missing information complicates and sometimes even precludes the generation of scientific knowledge on rare diseases. Therefore, starting in 2023, all in-patient cases in Germany with a rare disease diagnosis must be coded by an ORPHAcode using the Alpha-ID-SE file.The file Alpha-ID-SE links the ICD-10-GM codes to the internationally established ORPHAcodes for rare diseases. Commercially available software tools progressively support the coding of rare diseases. In several centers for rare diseases linked to university hospitals, IT tools and procedures were established to realize a complete coding of rare diseases. These include financial incentives for the institutions providing rare disease codes, systematic queries asking for rare disease codes during the coding process, and a semi-automated coding process for all patients with a rare disease previously seen at the institution. A combination of the different approaches probably results in the most complete coding.To get the complete picture of rare disease epidemiology and care requirements, a specific and unique coding of out-patient cases is also desirable. Furthermore, a structured reporting of phenotype is required, especially for complex rare diseases and for yet undiagnosed cases.

AB  - Automated clinical coding, facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques like natural language processing and machine learning, has emerged as a promising approach to enhance coding efficiency and accuracy in healthcare. This review synthesizes current knowledge about AI-based automated coding of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), with a focus on its challenges, benefits, and future research directions. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases on January 1, 2024. Studies discussing challenges, advantages, and research gaps in AI-driven ICD coding were included. Out of 12,641 identified records, eight studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies highlighted six key challenges: extensive label space, imbalanced label distribution, lengthy documents, coding interpretability issues, ethical concerns, and lack of transparency. Ten major benefits of AI-based ICD coding were identified, including improved decision-making, data standardization, and increased coding accuracy. In addition, eight future directions were proposed, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration, transfer learning, transparency enhancement, and active learning techniques. Despite significant challenges, AI-based ICD coding holds substantial potential to revolutionize clinical coding by improving efficiency and accuracy. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current evidence and actionable insights for advancing research and practical implementation of automated ICD coding systems.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In order to measure the medical activity in hospitals, physicians are required to code manually information concerning a patient's stay using ICD-10. This requires trained staff and a lot of time. We propose to help speed up and facilitate the tedious task of coding patient information. METHODS: we show two methods. First, we propose an automated ICD-10-based coding help system using an automated MeSH-based indexing system and a mapping between MeSH and ICD-10 extracted from the UMLS metathesaurus. Secondly, we propose the use of drug prescriptions to complete the previous coding with the use of a mapping between a given prescription drug and the relevant ICD-10 codes (in compliance with the drug approval). RESULTS: the results of a preliminary experiment indicate that the precision of the indexing system is 40% and the recall is 30% when we compare to an economic rules-based coding and to a descriptive coding. DISCUSSION: moreover, we show that the use of prescription coding is relevant as the recall reaches 68% when the Vidal tool is used. CONCLUSION: Then, it is very interesting to complete the coding obtained automatically by the indexing/mapping system by the coding obtained from the prescriptions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: For ICD-10 coding causes of death in France in 2018 and 2019, predictions by deep neural networks (DNNs) are employed in addition to fully automatic batch coding by a rule-based expert system and to interactive coding by the coding team focused on certificates with a special public health interest and those for which DNNs have a low confidence index. METHODS: Supervised seq-to-seq DNNs are trained on previously coded data to ICD-10 code multiple causes and underlying causes of death. The DNNs are then used to target death certificates to be sent to the coding team and to predict multiple causes and underlying causes of death for part of the certificates. Hence, the coding campaign for 2018 and 2019 combines three modes of coding and a loop of interaction between the three. FINDINGS: In this campaign, 62% of the certificates are automatically batch coded by the expert system, 3% by the coding team, and the remainder by DNNs. Compared to a traditional campaign that would have relied on automatic batch coding and manual coding, the present campaign reaches an accuracy of 93.4% for ICD-10 coding of the underlying cause (95.6% at the European shortlist level). Some limitations (risks of under- or overestimation) appear for certain ICD categories, with the advantage of being quantifiable. CONCLUSION: The combination of the three coding methods illustrates how artificial intelligence, automated and human codings are mutually enriching. Quantified limitations on some chapters of ICD codes encourage an increase in the volume of certificates sent for manual coding from 2021 onward.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) has been widely used to describe the diagnosis information of patients. Automatic ICD-10 coding is important because manually assigning codes is expensive, time consuming and error prone. Although numerous approaches have been developed to explore automatic coding, few of them have been applied in practice. Our aim is to construct a practical, automatic ICD-10 coding machine to improve coding efficiency and quality in daily work. METHODS: In this study, we propose the use of regular expressions (regexps) to establish a correspondence between diagnosis codes and diagnosis descriptions in outpatient settings and at admission and discharge. The description models of the regexps were embedded in our upgraded coding system, which queries a diagnosis description and assigns a unique diagnosis code. Like most studies, the precision (P), recall (R), F-measure (F) and overall accuracy (A) were used to evaluate the system performance. Our study had two stages. The datasets were obtained from the diagnosis information on the homepage of the discharge medical record. The testing sets were from October 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018 and from July 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019. RESULTS: The values of P were 89.27 and 88.38% in the first testing phase and the second testing phase, respectively, which demonstrate high precision. The automatic ICD-10 coding system completed more than 160,000 codes in 16 months, which reduced the workload of the coders. In addition, a comparison between the amount of time needed for manual coding and automatic coding indicated the effectiveness of the system-the time needed for automatic coding takes nearly 100 times less than manual coding. CONCLUSIONS: Our automatic coding system is well suited for the coding task. Further studies are warranted to perfect the description models of the regexps and to develop synthetic approaches to improve system performance.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate whether automated methods are sufficient for deriving ICD-10-CM algorithms by comparing ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM crosswalks from general equivalence mappings (GEMs) with physician/clinical coder-derived crosswalks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forward mapping was used to derive ICD-10-CM crosswalks for 10 conditions. As a sensitivity analysis, forward-backward mapping (FBM) was also conducted for three clinical conditions. The physician/coder independently developed crosswalks for the same conditions. Differences between the crosswalks were summarized using the Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC). RESULTS: Physician/coder crosswalks were typically far more inclusive than GEMs crosswalks. Crosswalks for peripheral artery disease were most dissimilar (JSC: 0.06), while crosswalks for mild cognitive impairment (JSC: 1) and congestive heart failure (0.85) were most similar. FBM added ICD-10-CM codes for all three conditions but did not consistently increase similarity between crosswalks. CONCLUSION: The GEMs and physician/coder algorithms rarely aligned fully; human review is still required for ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM crosswalk development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It remains unclear how to incorporate terminology changes, such as the International Classification of Disease (ICD) transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10, into established automated healthcare quality metrics. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether general equivalence mapping (GEM) can apply ICD-9 based metrics to ICD-10 patient data. To develop and validate novel ICD-10 reference codesets. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis for eleven Choosing Wisely (CW) metrics was performed using three scripted algorithms on an institutional clinical data warehouse. ICD-10 data were compared against published ICD-9 based metric definitions using two equivalence mapping algorithms. A third algorithm implemented novel reference ICD-10 codes matching the original ICD-9 codes' intent for comparison with patient ICD-10 data. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients seen at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, April - September 2016. MAIN MEASURES: The prevalence of eleven CW services during the six-month period. KEY RESULTS: The three algorithms found similar prevalence of avoidable CW services, with an unweighted-mean of 8.4% (range: 0.16-65%), or approximately 20,000 CW services out of 240,000 potential cases in 515,406 unique patients. The algorithms' median sensitivity was 0.80 (interquartile range: 0.75-0.95), median specificity was 0.88 (IQR: 0.77-0.94), and median Rand accuracy was 0.84 (IQR: 0.79-0.89). The attributed waste of these eleven services for the period ranged from $871,049 to $951,829 between methods. Accuracy assessment demonstrated that the GEM-based methods suffered recall losses for metrics requiring multistep mapping due to incompleteness, while novel ICD-10 metric definitions avoided these challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive mapping enables use of legacy metrics across ICD generations, but requires computational complexity that can be avoided with novel ICD-10 based metric definitions. Variation in the dollars attributed to waste due to ICD mapping introduces ambiguity that may affect quality-based reimbursement.

AB  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) can offer important tools for unlocking relevant information from clinical narratives. Although Transformer-based models can achieve remarkable results in several different NLP tasks, these models have been less used in clinical NLP, and particularly in low resource languages, of which Portuguese is one example. It is still not entirely clear whether pre-trained Transformer models are useful for clinical tasks, without further architecture engineering or particular training strategies. In this work, we propose a BERT model to assign ICD-10 codes for causes of death, by analyzing free-text descriptions in death certificates, together with the associated autopsy reports and clinical bulletins, from the Portuguese Ministry of Health. We used a novel pre-training procedure that incorporates in-domain knowledge, and also a fine-tuning method to address the class imbalance issue. Experimental results show that, in this particular clinical task that requires the processing of relatively short documents, Transformer-based models can achieve very strong results, significantly outperforming tailored approaches based on recurrent neural networks.

AB  - The International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), developed by the World Health Organization, is a coding system designed to classify diseases and ensure international comparability, thereby facilitating the statistical analysis of morbidity and mortality. ICD-10 is widely recognized as the standard for diagnostic classification. Taiwan adopted ICD-10 as its primary coding standard in 2016. With approximately 150,000 diagnostic and procedure codes-significantly more than the 17,000 codes in the previous ICD-9-this increased complexity has raised the workload for physicians and medical coders. Current observations indicate that inpatient cases often have fewer recorded diagnoses, resulting in the underestimation of critical risk factors, comorbidities, and complications. To address these challenges, this study proposes the development of an automated disease coding recommendation system using deep learning and natural language processing techniques. This system aims to assist physicians in coding decisions, optimize HIS interface design, improve the quality and completeness of medical record documentation, reduce the time physicians spend on coding tasks, and alleviate the overall workload associated with medical claim submissions.

AB  - Automated ICD coding, which assigns the International Classification of Disease codes to patient visits, has attracted much research attention since it can save time and labor for billing. The previous state-of-the-art model utilized one convolutional layer to build document representations for predicting ICD codes. However, the lengths and grammar of text fragments, which are closely related to ICD coding, vary a lot in different documents. Therefore, a flat and fixed-length convolutional architecture may not be capable of learning good document representations. In this paper, we proposed a

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reliable information which can only be derived from accurate data is crucial to the success of the health system. Since encoded data on diagnoses and procedures are put to a broad range of uses, the accuracy of coding is imperative. Accuracy of coding with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) is impeded by a manual coding process that is dependent on the medical records officers' level of experience/knowledge of medical terminologies. AIM STATEMENT: To improve the accuracy of ICD-10 coding of morbidity/mortality data at the general hospitals in Lagos State from 78.7% to ≥95% between March 2018 and September 2018. METHODS: A quality improvement (QI) design using the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle framework. The interventions comprised the introduction of an electronic diagnostic terminology software and training of 52 clinical coders from the 26 general hospitals. An end-of-training coding exercise compared the coding accuracy between the old method and the intervention. The outcome was continuously monitored and evaluated in a phased approach. RESULTS: Research conducted in the study setting yielded a baseline coding accuracy of 78.7%. The use of the difficult items (wrongly coded items) from the research for the end-of-training coding exercise accounted for a lower coding accuracy when compared with baseline. The difference in coding accuracy between manual coders (47.8%) and browser-assisted coders (54.9%) from the coding exercise was statistically significant. Overall average percentage coding accuracy at the hospitals over the 12-month monitoring and evaluation period was 91.3%. CONCLUSION: This QI initiative introduced a stop-gap for improving data coding accuracy in the absence of automated coding and electronic health record. It provides evidence that the electronic diagnostic terminology tool does improve coding accuracy and with continuous use/practice should improve reliability and coding efficiency in resource-constrained settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Natural language processing (NLP) can generate diagnoses codes from imaging reports. Meanwhile, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes are the United States' standard for billing/coding, which enable tracking disease burden and outcomes. This cross-sectional study aimed to test feasibility of an NLP algorithm's performance and comparison to radiologists' and physicians' manual coding. METHODS: Three neuroradiologists and one non-radiologist physician reviewers manually coded a randomly-selected pool of 200 craniospinal CT and MRI reports from a pool of >10,000. The NLP algorithm ( RESULTS: The algorithm extracted the reports' Impressions into 645 phrases, each having ranked ICD-10 matches. Regarding the reviewers' selected codes, pairwise agreement was unreliable ( CONCLUSIONS: Manual coding by physician reviewers has significant variability and is time-consuming, while the NLP algorithm's top 5 diagnosis codes are relatively accurate. This preliminary work demonstrates the feasibility and potential for generating codes with reliability and consistency. Future works may include correlating diagnosis codes with clinical encounter codes to evaluate imaging's impact on, and relevance to care.

AB  - Two hundred ninety-five injury descriptions from 135 consecutive patients treated at a level-I trauma center were coded by three human coders (H1, H2, H3) and by TRI-CODE (T), a PC-based artificial intelligence software program. Two study coders are nationally recognized experts who teach AIS coding for its developers (the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine); the third has 5 years experience in ICD and AIS coding. A "correct coding" (CC) was established for the study injury descriptions. Coding results were obtained for each coder relative to the CC. The correct ICD codes were selected in 96% of cases for H2, 92% for H1, 91% for T, and 86% for H3. The three human coders agreed on 222 (75%) injuries. The correct 7 digit AIS codes (six identifying digits and the severity digit) were selected in 93% of cases for H2, 87% for T, 77% for H3, and 73% for H1. The correct AIS severity codes (seventh digit only) were selected in 98.3% of cases for H2, 96.3% for T, 93.9% for H3, and 90.8% for H1. On the basis of the weighted kappa statistic TRI-CODE had excellent agreement with the correct coding (CC) of AIS severities. Each human coder had excellent agreement with CC and with TRI-CODE. Coders H1 and H2 were in excellent agreement. Coder H3 was in good agreement with H1 and H2. However, errors among the human coders often occur for different codes, accentuating the variability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - A crucial process for world-level mortality statistics is the capability to identify the underlying cause of death from death certificates. Currently such certificates are coded using ICD-10. The selection of the underlying cause is done by means of semi-automated rule-based systems. However, starting from 2022, countries should begin to adopt ICD-11, for which no system is already available. The present paper describes the architecture of a novel system for automated UC selection, with classification-independent rules, and its preliminary validation on two sets of death certificates coded with ICD-10 and ICD-11.

AB  - Automated protocoling for MRI examinations is an amendable target for workflow automation with artificial intelligence. However, there are still challenges to overcome for a successful and robust approach. These challenges are outlined and analyzed in this work. Through a literature review, we analyzed limitations of currently published approaches for automated protocoling. Then, we assessed these limitations quantitatively based on data from a private radiology practice. For this, we assessed the information content provided by the clinical indication by computing the overlap coefficients for the sets of ICD-10-coded admitting diagnoses of different MRI protocols. Additionally, we assessed the heterogeneity of protocol trees from three different MRI scanners based on the overlap coefficient, on MRI protocol and sequence level. Additionally, we applied sequence name standardization to demonstrate its effect on the heterogeneity assessment, i.e., the overlap coefficient, of different protocol trees. The overlap coefficient for the set of ICD-10-coded admitting diagnoses for different protocols ranges from 0.14 to 0.56 for brain/head MRI exams and 0.04 to 0.57 for spine exams. The overlap coefficient across the set of sequences used at two different scanners increases when applying sequence name standardization (from 0.81/0.86 to 0.93). Automated protocoling for MRI examinations has the potential to reduce the workload for radiologists. However, an automated protocoling approach cannot be solely based on admitting diagnosis as it does not provide sufficient information. Moreover, sequence name standardization increases the overlap coefficient across the set of sequences used at different scanners and therefore facilitates transfer learning.

AB  - Assigning medical codes for patients is essential for healthcare organizations, not only for billing purposes but also for maintaining accurate records of patients' medical histories and analyzing the outputs of certain procedures. Due to the abundance of disease codes, it can be laborious and time-consuming for medical specialists to manually assign these codes to each procedure. To address this problem, we discuss the automatic prediction of ICD-9 codes, the most popular and widely accepted system of medical coding. We introduce a two-stream deep learning framework specifically designed to analyze multi-modal data. This framework is applied to the extensive and publicly available MIMIC-III dataset, enabling us to leverage both numerical and text-based data for improved ICD-9 code prediction. Our system uses text representation models to understand the text-based medical records; the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model the numerical health records; and fuses these two streams to automatically predict the ICD-9 codes used in the intensive care unit. We discuss the preprocessing and classification methods and demonstrate that our proposed two-stream model outperforms other state-of-the-art studies in the literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is a major cause of death in many countries today. The way in which countries code causes of death determines the occurrence of dementia in statistics. The change over from manual to automated coding is accompanied by a 7-19% increase in the occurrence of dementia as the underlying cause of death. Because of this sudden change, researchers, physicians, policy makers, and press question the validity of the outcome of automated coding. Therefore, the role of dementia as a cause of death was investigated. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 700 certifiers who mentioned "dementia" on a death certificate in the second half of 2017. They were asked questions about the role of dementia as a cause of death. For each certificate, the opinion of the certifier was compared with the outcome of automated coding. RESULTS: A response of 65% (n = 446) was obtained. The automated coding system selected dementia as the underlying cause of death 9.5% points (95% CI: 5.8-14.4%) more often than the certifier would do. This finding in the sample corresponded to an overestimation of dementia in the cause-of-death statistics with 22.7% (95% CI: 18-28%). Main reason for this overestimation was the selection of dementia as the underlying cause of death by the automated coding system, while it was noted as the contributory cause of death on part 2 of the death certificate by the certifier. CONCLUSION: For international comparisons of data on dementia as a cause of death, the outcome of automated coding can be used as the system adheres to international (ICD-10) guidelines and reduces coding variations in and between countries. However, for interpreting the local (national) impact of dementia as a cause of death, the opinion of the certifier should be taken into account.

AB  - We address the assignment of ICD-10 codes for causes of death by analyzing free-text descriptions in death certificates, together with the associated autopsy reports and clinical bulletins, from the Portuguese Ministry of Health. We leverage a deep neural network that combines word embeddings, recurrent units, and neural attention, for the generation of intermediate representations of the textual contents. The neural network also explores the hierarchical nature of the input data, by building representations from the sequences of words within individual fields, which are then combined according to the sequences of fields that compose the inputs. Moreover, we explore innovative mechanisms for initializing the weights of the final nodes of the network, leveraging co-occurrences between classes together with the hierarchical structure of ICD-10. Experimental results attest to the contribution of the different neural network components. Our best model achieves accuracy scores over 89%, 81%, and 76%, respectively for ICD-10 chapters, blocks, and full-codes. Through examples, we also show that our method can produce interpretable results, useful for public health surveillance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Billing codes are utilized for medical reimbursement, clinical quality metric valuation and for epidemiologic purposes to report and follow disease trends and outcomes. The current paradigm of manual coding can be expensive, time-consuming, and subject to human error. Though automation of the billing codes has been widely reported in the literature via rule-based and supervised approaches, existing strategies lack generalizability and robustness towards large and constantly changing ICD hierarchical structure. METHOD: We propose a weakly supervised training strategy by leveraging contrastive learning, contrastive diagnosis embedding (CDE) to capture the fine semantic variations between the diagnosis codes. The approach consists of a two-phase contrastive training for generating the semantic embedding space adapted to incorporate hierarchical information of ICD-10 vocabulary and a weakly supervised retrieval scheme. Core strength of the proposed method is that it puts no limit on the 70 K ICD-10 codes set and can handle all rare codes for coding the diagnosis. RESULTS: Our CDE model outperformed string-based partial matching and ClinicalBERT embedding on three test cases (a retrospective testset, a prospective testset, and external testset) and produced an accurate prediction of rare and newly introduced diagnosis codes. A detailed ablation study showed the importance of each phase of the proposed multi-phase training. Each successive phase of training - ICD-10 group sensitive training (phase 1.1), ICD-10 subgroup sensitive training (phase 1.2), free-text diagnosis description-based training (phase 2) - improved performance beyond the previous phase of training. The model also outperformed existing supervised models like CAML and PLM-ICD and produced satisfactory performance on the rare codes. CONCLUSION: Compared to the existing rule-based and supervised models, the proposed weakly supervised contrastive learning overcomes the limitations in terms of generalization capability and increases the robustness of the automated billing. Such a model will allow flexibility through accurate billing code automation for practice convergence and gains efficiencies in a value-based care payment environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assigning International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes to clinical texts is a common and crucial practice in patient classification, hospital management, and further statistics analysis. Current auto-coding methods mainly transfer this task to a multi-label classification problem. Such solutions are suffering from high-dimensional mapping space and excessive redundant information in long clinical texts. To alleviate such a situation, we introduce text summarization methods to the ICD coding regime and apply text matching to select ICD codes. METHOD: We focus on the tenth revision of the ICD (ICD-10) coding and design a novel summarization-based approach (SuM) with an end-to-end strategy to efficiently assign ICD-10 code to clinical texts. In this approach, a knowledge-guided pointer network is purposed to distill and summarize key information in clinical texts precisely. Then a matching model with matching-aggregation architecture follows to align the summary result with code, tuning the one-vs-all scenario to one-vs-one matching so that the large-label-space obstacle laid in classification approaches would be avoided. RESULT: The 12,788 ICD-10 coded discharge summaries from a Chinese hospital were collected to evaluate the proposed approach. Compared with existing methods, the purposed model achieves the greatest coding results with Micro AUC of 0.9548, MRR@10 of 0.7977, Precision@10 of 0.0944, and Recall@10 of 0.9439 for the TOP-50 Dataset. Results on the FULL-Dataset remain consistent. Also, the proposed knowledge encoder and applied end-to-end strategy are proven to facilitate the whole model to gain efficacy in selecting the most suitable code. CONCLUSION: The proposed automatic ICD-10 code assignment approach via text summarization can effectively capture critical messages in long clinical texts and improve the performance of ICD-10 coding of clinical texts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the development of automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding models using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) dataset. This work integrates computer science and clinical perspectives to evaluate progress, identify challenges, and provide insights for future ICD coding automation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We selected 73 studies between 2014 and 2024 and extracted key information about data preprocessing, knowledge integration, model architectures, evaluation strategies, and explainability. RESULTS: In the reviewed papers, 69.57% (48 papers) focused on utilizing medical knowledge, primarily through knowledge graphs. The methods have evolved from traditional machine learning techniques to more advanced approaches, such as deep learning, knowledge reasoning, information retrieval, and generative models. Since 2019, F1-micro scores have consistently improved: Studies using the MIMIC-III full dataset have shown a 6.4% increase, while those using the MIMIC-III top-50 dataset have experienced a 10.2% improvement. Furthermore, 60.27% (44 papers) implemented strategies to enhance explainability, which included attention visualization and analysis. CONCLUSION: Automated ICD coding tasks have improved, but ongoing challenges remain. These challenges include a lack of diverse data, inadequate use of medical knowledge, complex algorithms, and insufficient validation by clinical coders. Those issues obstruct the model implementation. Future research should focus on integrating a wider range of multimodal data, enhancing the application of medical knowledge, and improving the explainability of models.

AB  - To develop an automated coding software related to the underlying causes of death, based on the National Registration Information System on deaths, which could improve the quality of coding on the underlying causes of death in the conventional death surveillance system. Following the coding rules of the underlying death cause of ICD-10 and the design on principles of software of underlying death cause automated coding from some other countries, as well as in accordance with the coding strategy table from the USA, we implemented the automatization of the underlying death cause coding. Based on national registration information system on cause of death, an automated coding software of underlying death cause was developed with the coding correction rate closed to 85%. The automated coding software of underlying death cause could code the death cases of underlying death cause with high rate of correction, similar to that of the same kind software developed in other countries.

AB  - Notes documented by clinicians, such as patient histories, hospital courses, lab reports and others are often annotated with standardized clinical codes by medical coders to facilitate a variety of secondary processing applications such as billing and statistical analyses. Clinical coding, traditionally manual and labor-intensive, has seen a surge in research interest by deep learning researchers pursuing to automate it. However, deep learning methods require large volumes of annotated clinical data for training and offer little to explain why codes were assigned to pieces of text. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method which does not need annotated clinical text and is fully interpretable, by using Named Entity and Attribute Recognition and word embeddings specialized for the clinical domain. These methods successfully glean important information from large volumes of clinical notes and encode them effectively in order to perform automatic clinical coding.

AB  - The increasing parallel use of ICD-9 and ICD-10 complicates the comparability of coded diagnoses. This is the reason why we developed a symmetric table for interactive conversion between ICD-9 and ICD-10, based on a vector space text-retrieval method that resulted in unambiguous mapping from ICD-9 to ICD-10 in 64%, from ICD-10 to ICD-9 in 87% of all three- and four-character classes of the tabular list. Out of the remaining 13% of multi-valued relations, a table for automated mapping from ICD-10 to ICD-9 was created. In 9% of cases, the selection offered no problems. A compromise between preserving information content and maintaining the logical integrity had to be found in 2.4%; in 1.6% automated mapping was impossible because of newly defined concepts and structural differences between ICD-9 and ICD-10 that are not counterbalanced by a consistent system of residual categories. We recommend that in a future revision of the ICD, compatibility with the then existing classification system should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The national mandate for health systems to transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 has an impact on research activities. Clinical phenotypes defined by ICD-9-CM codes need to be converted to ICD-10-CM, which has nearly four times more codes and a very different structure than ICD-9-CM. METHODS: We used the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) General Equivalent Maps (GEMs) to translate, using four different methods, condition-specific ICD-9-CM code sets used for pragmatic trials (n=32) into ICD-10-CM. We calculated the recall, precision, and F score of each method. We also used the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM value sets defined for electronic quality measure as an additional evaluation of the mapping methods. RESULTS: The forward-backward mapping (FBM) method had higher precision, recall and F-score metrics than simple forward mapping (SFM). The more aggressive secondary (SM) and tertiary mapping (TM) methods resulted in higher recall but lower precision. For clinical phenotype definition, FBM was the best (F=0.67), but was close to SM (F=0.62) and TM (F=0.60), judging on the F-scores alone. The overall difference between the four methods was statistically significant (one-way ANOVA, F=5.749, p=0.001). However, pairwise comparisons between FBM, SM, and TM did not reach statistical significance. A similar trend was found for the quality measure value sets. DISCUSSION: The optimal method for using the GEMs depends on the relative importance of recall versus precision for a given use case. It appears that for clinically distinct and homogenous conditions, the recall of FBM is sufficient. The performance of all mapping methods was lower for heterogeneous conditions. Since code sets used for phenotype definition and quality measurement can be very similar, there is a possibility of cross-fertilization between the two activities. CONCLUSION: Different mapping approaches yield different collections of ICD-10-CM codes. All methods require some level of human validation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection in hospitals is heavily reliant on spontaneous reporting by clinical staff, with studies in the literature pointing to high rates of underreporting [1]. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes have been used in epidemiological studies of ADRs and offer the potential for automated ADR detection systems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an automated ADR detection system based on ICD-10 codes, using machine-learning algorithms to improve accuracy and efficiency. METHODS: For a 12-month period from December 2016 to November 2017, every inpatient episode receiving an ICD-10 code in the range Y40.0-Y59.9 (ADR code) was flagged for review as a potential ADR. Each flagged admission was assessed by an expert pharmacist and, if needed, reviewed at regular ADR committee meetings. For each report, a determination was made about ADR probability and severity. The dataset was randomly split into training and test sets. A machine-learning model using the random forest algorithm was developed on the training set to discriminate between true and false ADR reports. The model was then applied to the test set to assess accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC). RESULTS: In the study period, 2917 Y40.0-Y59.9 codes were applied to admissions, resulting in 245 ADR reports after review. These 245 reports accounted for 44.5% of all ADR reporting in our hospital in the study period. A random forest model built on the training set was able to discriminate between true and false reports on the test set with an AUC of 0.803. CONCLUSIONS: Automated ADR detection using ICD-10 coding significantly improved ADR detection in the study period, with improved discrimination between true and false reports by applying a machine-learning model.

AB  - ICD coding, which involves assigning appropriate ICD codes to clinical notes, is essential for healthcare tasks such as health expense claims, insurance claims, and disease research. Manual ICD coding is time-consuming and prone to errors, increasing the need for automation. However, clinical notes often contain non-grammatical expressions, abbreviations, professional terms, and synonyms, making them notably noisy compared to general documents. Additionally, ICD coding faces challenges such as a broad label space and the long-tail problem, making automatic ICD coding highly challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in code extraction tasks due to their exceptional natural language understanding and information extraction capabilities. However, the unique characteristics of clinical records and ICD codes necessitate fine-tuning LLMs for optimal performance in ICD coding. In this study, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework for LLMs aimed at automatic ICD coding. Our framework introduces additional elements, including a label attention mechanism, note-relevant knowledge injection based on medical expressions, and knowledge-driven sampling to address the input token limitations of LLMs. Experiments on the MIMIC-III-50 dataset show that our framework outperforms vanilla fine-tuning in both micro and macro accuracy and F1 scores, with particularly significant improvements observed in encoder-decoder models.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the standard diagnostic tool for classifying and coding diseases and injuries. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is the most widely used injury severity scoring system. Although manual coding is considered the gold standard, it is sometimes unavailable or impractical. There have been many prior attempts to develop programs for the automated conversion of ICD rubrics into AIS codes. OBJECTIVE: To convert ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes into AIS 2005 (update 2008) codes via a derived map using a two-step process and, subsequently, to compare Injury Severity Score (ISS) resulting from said conversion with manually coded ISS values. METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was designed in which medical records at the Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla of Cantabria (HUMV) and the Complejo Hospitalario of Navarra (CHN), both in Spain, were reviewed. Coding of injuries using AIS 2005 (update 2008) version was done manually by a certified AIS specialist and ISS values were calculated. ICD-9-CM codes were automatically converted into ISS values by another certified AIS specialist in a two-step process. ISS scores obtained from manual coding were compared to those obtained through this conversion process. RESULTS: The comparison of obtained through conversion versus manual ISS resulted in 396 concordant pairs (70.2%); the analysis of values according to ISS categories (ISS<9, ISS 9-15, ISS 16-24, ISS>24) showed 493 concordant pairs (87.4%). Regarding the criterion of "major trauma" patient (i.e., ISS> 15), 538 matching pairs (95.2%) were obtained. The conversion process resulted in underestimation of ISS in 112 cases (19.9%) and conversion was not possible in 136 cases (19%) for different reasons. CONCLUSIONS: The process used in this study has proven to be a useful tool for selecting patients who meet the ISS>15 criterion for "major trauma". Further research is needed to improve the conversion process.

AB  - The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) is internationally used for coding diagnoses, with the ICD-10 German Modification (GM) being prescribed for morbidity coding in Germany. ICD-10-GM is subject to annual revisions. This can lead to backward compatibility issues leading to undesirable consequences for cross-version data analysis. A study of annual crosswalk-tables concerning 21 ICD-10-GM versions showed that the ratio of difficult transitions from an older to a newer version (0.89 %) and vice versa (0.48 %) is not particularly significant but should nevertheless not be neglected. In this paper we present two solutions (Neo4J database and FHIR ConceptMaps) for the automated handling of different ICD-10-GM versions.

AB  - Clinical notes are comprehensive files containing explicit information about a patient's visit. However, accurately assigning medical codes from clinical documents can be a persistent challenge due to the complexity of clinical data and the vast range of medical codes. Moreover, the large volume of medical records, the noisy medical records, and the uneven quality of coders all negatively impact the quality of the final codes. Deep learning technology has recently been integrated into automatic International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding tasks to improve accuracy. Nevertheless, the imbalanced class problem, the complexness of code associations, and the noise in lengthy records still restrict the advancement of ICD coding tasks in deep learning. Thus, we present the Note-code Interaction Denoising Network (NIDN) that employs the self-attention mechanism to pull critical semantic features in electronic medical records (EMRs). Our model utilizes the label attention mechanism for retaining code-specific text expression. We introduce Clinical Classifications Software coding for multitask learning, capturing the functional relationships of medical coding to oblige in model prediction. To minimize the impact of noise on model prediction and improve the label distribution imbalance, a denoising module is introduced to filter noise. Our practical consequences indicate that the model NIDN exceeds competitive models on a third version of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care data set.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Manual ICD-10 coding of German clinical texts is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to develop a semi-automated pipeline for efficient coding of unstructured medical documentation. STATE OF THE ART: Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuned language models that require large datasets and perform poorly on rare codes, particularly in low-resource languages such as German. CONCEPT: The proposed system integrates Named Entity Recognition, semantic and lexical retrieval, abbreviation resolution, and context-aware normalization within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework using a compact generative model. IMPLEMENTATION: The pipeline utilizes Sentence-BERT embeddings, FAISS indexing, and the Mistral-Small-Instruct model. ICD codes are assigned through a combination of semantic similarity and generative refinement among the top retrieval candidates. LESSONS LEARNED: Major sources of error were found in semantic retrieval and diagnosis normalization. Future improvements should focus on domain-specific German embeddings, more robust abbreviation handling, and enhanced context-aware prompting to increase accuracy and usability in clinical environments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), developed by the World Health Organization, standardizes health condition coding to support health care policy, research, and billing, but artificial intelligence automation, while promising, still underperforms compared with human accuracy and lacks the explainability needed for adoption in medical settings. OBJECTIVE: The potential of large language models for assisting medical coders in the ICD-10 coding was explored through the development of a computer-assisted coding system. This study aimed to augment human coding by initially identifying lead terms and using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based methods for computer-assisted coding enhancement. METHODS: The explainability dataset from the CodiEsp challenge (CodiEsp-X) was used, featuring 1000 Spanish clinical cases annotated with ICD-10 codes. A new dataset, CodiEsp-X-lead, was generated using GPT-4 to replace full-textual evidence annotations with lead term annotations. A Robustly Optimized BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Pretraining Approach transformer model was fine-tuned for named entity recognition to extract lead terms. GPT-4 was subsequently employed to generate code descriptions from the extracted textual evidence. Using a RAG approach, ICD codes were assigned to the lead terms by querying a vector database of ICD code descriptions with OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model. RESULTS: The fine-tuned Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach achieved an overall F1-score of 0.80 for ICD lead term extraction on the new CodiEsp-X-lead dataset. GPT-4-generated code descriptions reduced retrieval failures in the RAG approach by approximately 5% for both diagnoses and procedures. However, the overall explainability F1-score for the CodiEsp-X task was limited to 0.305, significantly lower than the state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.633. The diminished performance was partly due to the reliance on code descriptions, as some ICD codes lacked descriptions, and the approach did not fully align with the medical coder's workflow. CONCLUSIONS: While lead term extraction showed promising results, the subsequent RAG-based code assignment using GPT-4 and code descriptions was less effective. Future research should focus on refining the approach to more closely mimic the medical coder's workflow, potentially integrating the alphabetic index and official coding guidelines, rather than relying solely on code descriptions. This alignment may enhance system accuracy and better support medical coders in practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A classification system that categorizes International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes into clinically meaningful categories is important for pediatric clinical and health services research using administrative data. While a Pediatric Clinical Classification System (PECCS) is available for the United States ICD-10 system (i.e, ICD-10-CM), differences in the ICD-10 system between countries limits PECCS use in Canada. OBJECTIVE: To translate PECCS from ICD-10-CM to ICD-10-CA for use in Canada (PECCS-CA), and examine the utility of PECCS-CA in administrative data of pediatric hospital encounters in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: PECCS was translated by mapping each ICD-10-CA code to its corresponding ICD-10-CM code, based on code description and alphanumeric code, using automated functions in Microsoft Excel. All unmatched ICD-10-CA codes were manually matched to an ICD-10-CM code. The ICD-10-CA codes were mapped to a PECCS category based on the placement of the corresponding ICD-10-CM code. Finally, in this cross-sectional study, the utility of PECCS-CA was examined in pediatric hospital encounters in children <18 years of age with an inpatient or same day surgery encounter, between April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2019 in Ontario. RESULTS: In total, 16,992 ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes were mapped to 781 mutually exclusive condition categories that included pediatric specific conditions and treatments in PECCS-CA. From the 781 categories, 777 (99.5%) were derived from the original PECCS, 3 (0.4%) from merging the original PECCS categories, and 1 (0.1%) was newly developed. The PECCS-CA was applied to health administrative data of 911,732 hospital encounters in children. The most prevalent condition in children was low birth weight (n = 54,100 encounters). CONCLUSION: The PECCS-CA is an open-source classification system which maps ICD-10-CA codes into 781 clinically important pediatric categories. The PECCS-CA can be used for pediatric health services and outcomes research in Canada.

AB  - It is unknown whether the digital application of automated ICD-9-CM codes recorded in the medical history are useful for a first screening in the detection of polypathological patients. In this study, the objective was to identify the degree of intra- and inter-observer concordance in the identification of in-patient polypathological patients between the standard clinical identification method and a new automatic method, using the basic minimum data set of ICD-9-CM codes in the digital medical history. For this, a cross-sectional multicenter study with 1518 administratively discharged patients from Andalusian hospitals during the period of 2013-2014 has been carried out. For the concordance between the clinical definition of a polypathological patient and the polypathological patient classification according to ICD-9-CM coding, a 0.661 kappa was obtained (95% confidence interval (CI); 0.622-0.701) with

AB  - Automatic alerting systems (AASs) can identify adverse health events but emergency communication relies on human operators and natural languages. For complete automation, we need to code the diversity of adverse events in a granularity that supports optimal dispatches. Hence, AAs shall integrate with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The ICD-11 coding system includes chapters for external causes of injury. However, ICD-11 supports coding injury incidents in electronic health records (EHRs) after they have occurred, while disregarding integrating real-time injury reporting within its framework. We explore the potential challenges associated with integrating ICD-11 into AAS by analyzing external causes of morbidity or mortality and the dimensions of external causes as potential areas of integration. We recognize the themes: (i) incident of injury, (ii) mode of transport, (iii) indoor location, (iv) outdoor location, and (v) type of building, and identify four challenges: (i) conceptual differences between the two systems, (ii) injury identification, (iii) presence of entities below the shoreline in ICD-11, and (iv) lack of specificity in certain ICD-11 codes related to AASs. For easy integration of ICD-11 into AASs, we recommend an AAS data dictionary and propose ICD-11 updates related to external causes of injury.

AB  - International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is an authoritative health care classification system of different diseases. It is widely used for disease and health records, assisted medical reimbursement decisions, and collecting morbidity and mortality statistics. The most existing ICD coding models only translate the simple diagnosis descriptions into ICD codes. And it obscures the reasons and details behind specific diagnoses. Besides, the label (code) distribution is uneven. And there is a dependency between labels. Based on the above considerations, the knowledge graph and attention mechanism were expanded into medical code prediction to improve interpretability. In this study, a new method called G_Coder was presented, which mainly consists of Multi-CNN, graph presentation, attentional matching, and adversarial learning. The medical knowledge graph was constructed by extracting entities related to ICD-9 from freebase. Ontology contains 5 entity classes, which are disease, symptom, medicine, surgery, and examination. The result of G_Coder on the MIMIC-III dataset showed that the micro-F1 score is 69.2% surpassing the state of art. The following conclusions can be obtained through the experiment: G_Coder integrates information across medical records using Multi-CNN and embeds knowledge into ICD codes. Adversarial learning is used to generate the adversarial samples to reconcile the writing styles of doctor. With the knowledge graph and attention mechanism, most relevant segments of medical codes can be explained. This suggests that the knowledge graph significantly improves the precision of code prediction and reduces the working pressure of the human coders.

AB  - Automatic ICD-10 coding is an unresolved challenge in terms of Machine Learning tasks. Despite hospitals generating an enormous amount of clinical documents, data is considerably sparse, associated with a very skewed and unbalanced code distribution, what entails reduced interoperability. In addition, in some languages the availability of coded documents is very limited. This paper proposes a cross-lingual approach based on Machine Translation methods to code death certificates with ICD-10 using supervised learning. The aim of this approach is to increase the availability of coded documents by combining collections of different languages, which may also contribute to reduce their possible bias in the ICD distribution, i.e. to avoid the promotion of a subset of codes due to service or environmental factors. A significant improvement in system performance is achieved for those labels with few occurrences.

AB  - The International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC) updates the widely used Birch and Marsden classification scheme. ICCC is based on the second edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-2). The purpose of the new classification is to accommodate important changes in recognition of different types of neoplasms, while preserving continuity with the original classification. The grouping of neoplasms into 12 main diagnostic groups is maintained. The major changes are: (1) intracranial and intraspinal germ-cell tumours now constitute a separate subgroup within germ-cell tumours; (2) histiocytosis X (Langerhans-cell histiocytosis) is excluded from ICCC; (3) Kaposi's sarcoma is a separate subgroup within soft-tissue sarcomas; (4) skin carcinoma is a separate subgroup within epithelial neoplasms; (5) "other specified" and "unspecified" neoplasms are now usually separate sub-categories within the main diagnostic groups. Draft copies of the ICCC were distributed to some 200 professionals with interest and expertise in the field and their comments are considered in this final version. This classification will be used for presentation of data in the second volume of the IARC Scientific Publication "International Incidence of Childhood Cancer." A computer programme for automated classification of childhood tumours coded according to ICD-O-1 or ICD-O-2 is now available from IARC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Effective management hinges on early diagnosis, which is often impeded by non-specific symptoms and resource-intensive diagnostic methods. This study assesses the effectiveness of electrocardiograms (ECGs) analysed via deep learning as a tool for early COPD detection. METHODS: We utilised a Convolutional Neural Network model to analyse ECGs for detecting COPD. The primary outcome was the accuracy of a new clinical COPD diagnosis as determined by ICD codes. Performance was evaluated using Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) metrics derived by testing against ECGs from a set of holdout patients, ECGs from patients from another hospital, and ECGs of patients with COPD within the UK BioBank (UKBB). FINDINGS: We analysed a total of 208,231 ECGs from 18,225 COPD cases, matched to 49,356 controls by age, sex, and race. The model exhibited robust performance across diverse populations with an AUC of 0⋅80 (0⋅80-0⋅80) in internal testing, 0⋅82 (0⋅81-0⋅82) in external validation and 0⋅75 (0⋅71-0⋅78) in the UKBB cohort. Subsequent analyses linked ECG-derived model predictions with spirometry data, and model explainability highlighted P-wave changes as indicative of COPD. INTERPRETATION: AI-powered ECG analysis offers a promising path for early COPD detection, potentially facilitating earlier and more effective management. Implementing such tools in clinical settings could significantly enhance COPD screening and diagnostic accuracy, thereby improving patient outcomes and addressing the global health burden of the disease. FUNDING: This work was supported in part through the computational and data resources and staff expertise provided by Scientific Computing and Data at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and supported by the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) grant UL1TR004419 from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; and R01HL167050-02 from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

AB  - Excessive paperwork is a considerable issue that leads to additional burdens for health-care professionals. In Thai health-care systems, physicians manually review medical records to select an appropriate principle diagnosis and other co-morbidities and convert them into ICD-10s to claim financial support from the government. Accordingly, 160,000 ICD-10 codes and 46,000 in-patient discharge summaries are documented by physicians at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital each year. As a result, to decrease physicians' burden of manual paper-work, we created a new approach to automatically analyse discharge summary notes and map the diagnoses to ICD-10s. We combined SNOMED-CT and natural language processing techniques within the approach through 3 steps: cleaning data; extracting keywords from discharge summary notes; and matching keywords to ICD-10. In this paper, we present that mapping clinical documents by using approximate matching and SNOMED-CT shows potential to be used for automating the ICD-10 mapping process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this paper we focus on the problem of automatically constructing ICD-9-CM coding systems for radiology reports. ICD-9-CM codes are used for billing purposes by health institutes and are assigned to clinical records manually following clinical treatment. Since this labeling task requires expert knowledge in the field of medicine, the process itself is costly and is prone to errors as human annotators have to consider thousands of possible codes when assigning the right ICD-9-CM labels to a document. In this study we use the datasets made available for training and testing automated ICD-9-CM coding systems by the organisers of an International Challenge on Classifying Clinical Free Text Using Natural Language Processing in spring 2007. The challenge itself was dominated by entirely or partly rule-based systems that solve the coding task using a set of hand crafted expert rules. Since the feasibility of the construction of such systems for thousands of ICD codes is indeed questionable, we decided to examine the problem of automatically constructing similar rule sets that turned out to achieve a remarkable accuracy in the shared task challenge. RESULTS: Our results are very promising in the sense that we managed to achieve comparable results with purely hand-crafted ICD-9-CM classifiers. Our best model got a 90.26% F measure on the training dataset and an 88.93% F measure on the challenge test dataset, using the micro-averaged F beta=1 measure, the official evaluation metric of the International Challenge on Classifying Clinical Free Text Using Natural Language Processing. This result would have placed second in the challenge, with a hand-crafted system achieving slightly better results. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that hand-crafted systems - which proved to be successful in ICD-9-CM coding - can be reproduced by replacing several laborious steps in their construction with machine learning models. These hybrid systems preserve the favourable aspects of rule-based classifiers like good performance, and their development can be achieved rapidly and requires less human effort. Hence the construction of such hybrid systems can be feasible for a set of labels one magnitude bigger, and with more labeled data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotyping infers whether a patient has a disease based on the information in his or her EHR. A human-annotated training set with gold-standard disease status labels is usually required to build an algorithm for phenotyping based on a set of predictive features. The time intensiveness of annotation and feature curation severely limits the ability to achieve high-throughput phenotyping. While previous studies have successfully automated feature curation, annotation remains a major bottleneck. In this paper, we present PheNorm, a phenotyping algorithm that does not require expert-labeled samples for training. METHODS: The most predictive features, such as the number of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes or mentions of the target phenotype, are normalized to resemble a normal mixture distribution with high area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for prediction. The transformed features are then denoised and combined into a score for accurate disease classification. RESULTS: We validated the accuracy of PheNorm with 4 phenotypes: coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. The AUCs of the PheNorm score reached 0.90, 0.94, 0.95, and 0.94 for the 4 phenotypes, respectively, which were comparable to the accuracy of supervised algorithms trained with sample sizes of 100-300, with no statistically significant difference. CONCLUSION: The accuracy of the PheNorm algorithms is on par with algorithms trained with annotated samples. PheNorm fully automates the generation of accurate phenotyping algorithms and demonstrates the capacity for EHR-driven annotations to scale to the next level - phenotypic big data.

AB  - The accurate classification of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes is a complex and critical multi-label task in clinical documentation, involving the assignment of diagnostic codes to medical discharge summaries. Existing automated methods face challenges due to the sparsity and nuanced nature of medical text, while traditional backpropagation-based models often lack flexibility and robustness. To address these issues, we propose Labeled Graph Generation with Node Representation Grasp (LGG-NRGrasp), an advanced adversarial learning framework that models ICD coding as a labeled graph generation problem. By leveraging a hierarchical structure to refine feature learning, our approach addresses the issue of over-smoothing in deep graph neural networks. A key innovation of LGG-NRGrasp is the integration of adversarial reinforcement learning and domain adaptation techniques, which enhance its ability to generalize across heterogeneous datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets indicate that LGG-NRGrasp markedly surpasses leading models, exhibiting enhanced performance and dependability in automated ICD coding.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Understanding and responding to emergency department (ED) presentations for suicide and self-harm is a major health system priority. Reporting using routinely collected ED diagnoses or presenting problem codes leads to significant underestimation of rates. We aimed to implement an enhanced method for reporting ED self-harm presentations in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. METHODS: An enhanced method was developed based on a literature review and clinical consultation. For NSW ED data collection records from 2005-2020, presenting problem codes were mapped to International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10). Self-harm codes (ICD-10 X60-84, Y87.0) were combined with additional codes for poisoning with medications commonly used in overdose and automated keyword searching of presenting problem text. Enhanced ED diagnoses were validated against hospital diagnoses for presentations resulting in hospital admission. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: Core ICD-10 self-harm codes identified 21 797 suicide and self-harm-related presentations per year to NSW EDs, of which 79% were for suicide-related ideation (R45.81). The enhanced method increased estimated annual presentations to 51 822 and increased sensitivity for suicide-related behaviours from 12.2% to 73.9%, while retaining high specificity (99.4%). Results matched known demographics of ED self-harm, and revised estimates were consistent with population rates reported by other jurisdictions. Service feedback and data sharing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic suggest that estimates from the enhanced method are plausible and sensitive to change. CONCLUSIONS: In NSW ED data, standard presenting problem codes recorded by clinicians detect less than half of presentations for self-harm or suicidal ideas. An enhanced method using additional codes and free text searching is computationally simple and increases sensitivity for monitoring trends and service performance. The method will continue to be refined as new data items become available.

AB  - Medical diagnosis coding is essential for hospital operations, yet the current process-reviewing patient files, searching for diagnoses, and assigning codes-can be time-consuming and error-prone. We propose a semi-automated system, the Smart Data Extractor, designed to streamline this task by extracting ICD-10 codes from electronic health records. In our evaluation, a medical expert using the Smart Data Extractor assigned 537 ICD-10 codes for 125 hospital stays in just 92 minutes, compared to 275 codes in 240 minutes when coding manually for the same patients. Moreover, manual coding resulted in more errors. Our solution is user-friendly, transparent, and efficient, requiring no prior training while significantly improving coding speed and accuracy. The Smart Data Extractor offers a practical, time-saving alternative to traditional coding methods, enhancing both productivity and reliability in hospital settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most of the current scores and outcome prediction calculations in traumatology are based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). However, this is not routinely used for documentation and coding of injuries in many countries, including Germany. Instead of the AIS, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is used. While the ICD functions as the basis for automated calculating of the diagnosis-related groups (DRG), no possibility of simple conversion of the 10th version of the ICD into AIS is available so far. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work is to develop and apply a methodology for simple conversion from ICD 10 to current AIS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The developed mapping procedure was based on a 1 : n relationship between trauma codes of ICD-10-GM and the codes of the AIS2005. Calculated ISS from the conversion codes were then compared with the actual ISS coding available from the clinical trauma documentation. RESULTS: It can be shown that, despite the considerable differences in the structure and systematic of both classification systems, an automated translation is technically possible. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary result of the mapping suggests, however, that despite the technical feasibility of a reliable conversion and comparability of ICD 10 and AIS in the required quality is still questionable. An automated conversion is still possible and quality would possibly improve by inclusion of additional information.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Semi-automated surveillance systems save time compared with traditional manual methods, particularly for non-ventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia (nvHAP), a nosocomial infection which can affect all non-intubated patients. In semi-automated surveillance, a computerized algorithm selects patients with high probability (i.e. "at risk") for subsequent manual confirmation. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of several single indicators and algorithms to preselect patients at risk for nvHAP. METHODS: Single nvHAP indicators, identified based on literature, expert opinion and data availability, were combined to simple and complex algorithms. Both single indicators and algorithms were applied on a patient cohort of 157 902 patients, including 947 patients with nvHAP according to our reference standard, i.e. validated semi-automated nvHAP surveillance system plus the manual surveillance of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia discharge diagnostic codes. Performance characteristics like sensitivity, workload reduction, and number of patients needed to be screened to detect one case of nvHAP were assessed. RESULTS: Compared with the reference standard, single indicators had a sensitivity ranging from 35.1% (332/947) (oxygen desaturation) to 99.7% (944/947) (radiologic procedure). The workload reduction varied from 57.3% (90 505/157 902) (length of hospital stay >5 days) to 98.4% (155 453/157 902) (ICD-10 discharge diagnostic code). The highest workload reduction was found in complex algorithms, e.g. the combination "radiologic procedure including full text AND temporally related abnormal white blood count or fever AND antimicrobials AND C-reactive protein AND decreased oxygenation AND hospital stay ≥5 days AND no intubation" which reduced the number of patients who have to undergo manual review by 96.2% (151 867/157 902), while maintaining a sensitivity of 92% (871/947). The number needed to screen applying this algorithm was 6.4 patients. DISCUSSION: Several single indicators and algorithms showed a high workload reduction and a sensitivity above the defined threshold of 90%. Our results could assist hospitals or stakeholders of surveillance initiatives in developing algorithms customized to their local conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy in patients with diverticulosis can be technically challenging and limited data exist relating to the risk of post-colonoscopy diverticulitis. Our aim was to evaluate the incidence, management, and outcomes of acute diverticulitis following colonoscopy. METHODS: Study design is retrospective cohort study. Data were gathered by conducting an automated search of the electronic patient database using current procedural terminology and ICD-9 codes. Patients who underwent a colonoscopy from 2003 to 2012 were reviewed to find patients who developed acute diverticulitis within 30 days after colonoscopy. Patient demographics and colonoscopy-related outcomes were documented, which include interval between colonoscopy and diverticulitis, colonoscopy indication, simultaneous colonoscopic interventions, and follow-up after colonoscopy. RESULTS: From 236,377 colonoscopies performed during the study period, 68 patients (mean age 56 years) developed post-colonoscopy diverticulitis (0.029%; 2.9 per 10,000 colonoscopies). Incomplete colonoscopies were more frequent among patients with a history of previous diverticulitis [n = 10 (29%) vs. n = 3 (9%), p = 0.03]. Mean time to develop diverticulitis after colonoscopy was 12 ± 8 days, and 30 (44%) patients required hospitalization. 34 (50%) patients had a history of diverticulitis prior to colonoscopy. Among those patients, 14 underwent colonoscopy with an indication of surveillance for previous disease. When colonoscopy was performed within 6 weeks of a diverticulitis attack, surgical intervention was required more often when compared with colonoscopies performed after 6 weeks of an acute attack [n = 6 (100%) vs. n = 10 (36%), p = 0.006]. 6 (9%) out of 68 patients received emergency surgical treatment. 15 (24%) out of 62 patients who had non-surgical treatment initially underwent an elective sigmoidectomy at a later date. Recurrent diverticulitis developed in 16 (23%) patients after post-colonoscopy diverticulitis. CONCLUSIONS: Post-colonoscopy diverticulitis is a rare, but potentially serious complication. Although a rare entity, possibility of this complication should be kept in mind in patients presenting with symptoms after colonoscopy.

AB  - The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code is a diagnostic classification standard that is frequently used as a referencing system in healthcare and insurance. However, it takes time and effort to find and use the right diagnosis code based on a patient's medical records. In response, deep learning (DL) methods have been developed to assist physicians in the ICD coding process. Our findings propose a deep learning model that utilized clinical notes from medical records to predict ICD-10 codes. Our research used text-based medical data from the outpatient department (OPD) of a university hospital from January to December 2016. The dataset used clinical notes from five departments, and a total of 21,953 medical records were collected. Clinical notes consisted of a subjective component, objective component, assessment, plan (SOAP) notes, diagnosis code, and a drug list. The dataset was divided into two groups: 90% for training and 10% for test cases. We applied natural language processing (NLP) technique (word embedding, Word2Vector) to process the data. A deep learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model was created based on the information presented above. Three metrics (precision, recall, and F-score) were used to calculate the achievement of the deep learning CNN model. Clinically acceptable results were achieved through the deep learning model for five departments (precision: 0.53-0.96; recall: 0.85-0.99; and F-score: 0.65-0.98). With a precision of 0.95, a recall of 0.99, and an F-score of 0.98, the deep learning model performed the best in the department of cardiology. Our proposed CNN model significantly improved the prediction performance for an automated ICD-10 code prediction system based on prior clinical information. This CNN model could reduce the laborious task of manual coding and could assist physicians in making a better diagnosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records linked with biorepositories are a powerful platform for translational studies. A major bottleneck exists in the ability to phenotype patients accurately and efficiently. The objective of this study was to develop an automated high-throughput phenotyping method integrating International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and narrative data extracted using natural language processing (NLP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a mapping method for automatically identifying relevant ICD and NLP concepts for a specific phenotype leveraging the Unified Medical Language System. Along with health care utilization, aggregated ICD and NLP counts were jointly analyzed by fitting an ensemble of latent mixture models. The multimodal automated phenotyping (MAP) algorithm yields a predicted probability of phenotype for each patient and a threshold for classifying participants with phenotype yes/no. The algorithm was validated using labeled data for 16 phenotypes from a biorepository and further tested in an independent cohort phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) for 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms with known associations. RESULTS: The MAP algorithm achieved higher or similar AUC and F-scores compared to the ICD code across all 16 phenotypes. The features assembled via the automated approach had comparable accuracy to those assembled via manual curation (AUCMAP 0.943, AUCmanual 0.941). The PheWAS results suggest that the MAP approach detected previously validated associations with higher power when compared to the standard PheWAS method based on ICD codes. CONCLUSION: The MAP approach increased the accuracy of phenotype definition while maintaining scalability, thereby facilitating use in studies requiring large-scale phenotyping, such as PheWAS.

AB  - It remains unclear whether the change from a manual to an automated coding system (ACS) for deaths has significantly affected the consistency of Australian mortality data. The underlying causes of 34,000 deaths registered in 1997 in Australia were dual coded, in ICD-9 manually, and by using an automated computer coding program. The diseases most affected by the change from manual to ACS were senile/presenile dementia, and pneumonia. The most common disease to which a manually assigned underlying cause of senile dementia was coded with ACS was unspecified psychoses (37.2%). Only 12.5% of codes assigned by ACS as senile dementia were coded the same by manual coders. This study indicates some important differences in mortality rates when comparing mortality data that have been coded manually with those coded using an automated computer coding program. These differences may be related to both the different interpretation of ICD coding rules between manual and automated coding, and different co-morbidities or co-existing conditions among demographic groups.

AB  - Clinical information systems have become large repositories for semi-structured and partly annotated electronic health record data, which have reached a critical mass that makes them interesting for supervised data-driven neural network approaches. We explored automated coding of 50 character long clinical problem list entries using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and evaluated three different types of network architectures on the top 100 ICD-10 three-digit codes. A fastText baseline reached a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.83, followed by a character-level LSTM with a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.84. The top performing approach used a downstreamed RoBERTa model with a custom language model, yielding a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.88. A neural network activation analysis together with an investigation of the false positives and false negatives unveiled inconsistent manual coding as a main limiting factor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: International Classification of Diseases codes are widely used to describe diagnosis information, but manual coding relies heavily on human interpretation, which can be expensive, time consuming, and prone to errors. With the transition from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), the coding process has become more complex, highlighting the need for automated approaches to enhance coding efficiency and accuracy. Inaccurate coding can result in substantial financial losses for hospitals, and a precise assessment of outcomes generated by a natural language processing (NLP)-driven autocoding system thus assumes a critical role in safeguarding the accuracy of the Taiwan diagnosis related groups (Tw-DRGs). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of applying an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), autocoding system that can automatically determine diagnoses and codes based on free-text discharge summaries to facilitate the assessment of Tw-DRGs, specifically principal diagnosis and major diagnostic categories (MDCs). METHODS: By using the patient discharge summaries from Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital (KMUCHH) from April 2019 to December 2020 as a reference data set we developed artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted ICD-10-CM coding systems based on deep learning models. We constructed a web-based user interface for the AI-assisted coding system and deployed the system to the workflow of the certified coding specialists (CCSs) of KMUCHH. The data used for the assessment of Tw-DRGs were manually curated by a CCS with the principal diagnosis and MDC was determined from discharge summaries collected at KMUCHH from February 2023 to April 2023. RESULTS: Both the reference data set and real hospital data were used to assess performance in determining ICD-10-CM coding, principal diagnosis, and MDC for Tw-DRGs. Among all methods, the GPT-2 (OpenAI)-based model achieved the highest F CONCLUSIONS: An NLP-driven AI-assisted coding system can assist CCSs in ICD-10-CM coding by offering coding references via a user interface, demonstrating the potential to reduce the manual workload and expedite Tw-DRG assessment. Consistency in performance affirmed the effectiveness of the system in supporting CCSs in ICD-10-CM coding and the judgment of Tw-DRGs.

AB  - The natural language approach to diagnosis encoding will certainly become a widespread technique during the second half of this decade. Accessing standard codes by numbers and keywords will be more and more considered a loss of time and efficiency. We present a demonstration of a natural language based encoding system for ICD, called LUCID, which considerably alleviates the burden of coding with ICD classification and enhances the quality of the encoded list of diagnoses. This tool, delivered on a PC platform, is very convivial and provides a versatile interface to any existing application based on Microsoft Windows standards.

AB  - Medical examiners have a unique database about trauma victims, many, if not most, of whom died at the scene or in transit to a hospital and who, thus, never had their injuries documented by trauma surgeons and so never entered into a local or regional trauma registry. These trauma registries have assisted in assessing the magnitude of traumatic injuries in the community and in evaluating the community's emergency medical systems. Without information about those who are dead at the scene or who die in transit, these trauma registries are incomplete and the evaluations based on them inaccurate. The data about the 50% of trauma victims who never enter the medical system are lacking in these registries. Such information is present in the death investigation and autopsy reports in the various medical examiner/coroner offices in the country. To access this important information more easily in trauma registries, an expert computer system was developed. This pilot study presents the results of using that system to gather medical examiner data. Injury descriptions were abstracted from autopsy reports of 50 consecutive nonhospitalized persons fatally injured in Mobile County, Alabama and its environs. Injury descriptions for all cases were successfully coded in International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS-90) by an expert system. For some cases the expert system "requested" and received clarifying information, all of which was present in the medical records. This research demonstrates the feasibility of gathering accurate and consistent information on the estimated 50% of trauma deaths who do not reach a hospital and who are not included in acute care registries. Without data on such patients, our evaluation of trauma systems is incomplete and resources directed at prevention and treatment may be misapplied.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of codes for documenting healthcare concepts has expanded from a historical need to collect statistics to today's wide array of clinical and other secondary uses. The most deeply embedded system for coding diagnoses is the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD). WHO's eleventh revision, ICD-11, was evaluated to determine how best to meet the needs of stakeholders concerned about clinical quality, healthcare decision-making, and other secondary use cases. METHODS: This study explored the capability of ICD-10-CM, the standard ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (ICD-11-MMS), and an enhanced ICD-11-MMS prototype (ICD-11-CCL) to represent clinical patient profiles for two natural clinical language scenarios. Systems were evaluated for granularity, comprehensiveness, accuracy, precision, relevancy, and their capability to provide user-friendly coding support. RESULTS: Both the standard and enhanced ICD-11-MMS produced code clusters that captured more clinical details and insight than ICD-10-CM's codes. However, ICD-11-MMS was less comprehensive than ICD-11-CCL and introduced occasional new inaccuracies. Unlike ICD-10-CM and ICD-11-MMS, ICD-11-CCL enabled clinicians to designate their clinical perspectives directly. While ICD-11-MMS produced numerous synonymous code clusters, the enhanced syntax of ICD-11-CCL resulted in a unique code cluster for each scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Adoption of an enhanced ICD-11-MMS such as ICD-11-CCL could provide clinically nuanced data to support important secondary data applications more effectively than standard ICD-11-MMS, while retaining ICD-11-MMS's capability to support international comparative analyses such as mortality and morbidity statistics. With automated coding tools, enhanced ICD-11-MMS could also reduce the burden on humans to select, review, memorize or decipher codes. Enhanced ICD-11-MMS represents a substantial improvement over customized modifications of ICD-10 and, with further development and testing, could be a viable option for future adoption.

AB  - Preoperative optimization clinics enhance surgical outcomes by optimizing patients' health, reducing unnecessary tests, and minimizing cancellations. Artificial intelligence (AI) now promises to further advance these efforts by improving predictive modeling, automating risk assessments, and enabling personalized care strategies. AI models have shown particular strength in predicting postoperative complications, such as cardiovascular events. Tools like natural language processing (NLP) have also improved risk detection for conditions like alcohol misuse. The historical development of preoperative clinics-from Dr. J Alfred Lee's initial concept in 1949 to modern models like Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) and Anesthesia Preoperative Evaluation Clinic (APEC)-laid the groundwork for today's integration of electronic health records (EHRs) and decision-support systems, now evolving toward AI-driven care. Machine-learning algorithms have proven superior to traditional models for predicting postoperative anemia, opioid dependence, diabetes complications, and mortality risks, thus offering precise stratification and resource optimization. Specific applications include AI-assisted anemia management, penicillin allergy delabelling, and opioid use prediction after major surgeries. AI also enhances patient education through tools like ChatGPT and improves smoking cessation efforts using conversational AI. NLP has demonstrated better accuracy than standard International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes in identifying risky alcohol use (>2 standard drinks per day before surgery). However, barriers to widespread adoption include data privacy, algorithmic bias, and clinician skepticism. Future studies should focus on validating AI models across diverse populations and integrating AI recommendations within clinical workflows while adhering to evolving regulatory standards. Ultimately, AI's incorporation into preoperative assessments could significantly boost the efficiency and impact of clinic resources, potentially shifting outcomes more favorably by improving the slope of resource utilization versus patient outcome curves. Continued research and refinement are essential for AI to achieve its full potential in perioperative medicine.

AB  - In medicine, as in other domains, indexing and classification is a natural human task which is used for information retrieval and representation. In the medical field, encoding of patient discharge summaries is still a manual time-consuming task. This paper describes an automated coding system of patient discharge summaries from the field of coronary diseases into the ICD-9-CM classification. The system is developed in the context of the European AIM MENELAS project, a natural-language understanding system which uses the conceptual-graph formalism. Indexing is performed by using a two-step processing scheme; a first recognition stage is implemented by a matching procedure and a secondary selection stage is made according to the coding priorities. We show the general features of the necessary translation of the classification terms in the conceptual-graph model, and for the coding rules compliance. An advantage of the system is to provide an objective evaluation and assessment procedure for natural-language understanding.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Identification of diagnostic error is complex and mostly relies on expert ratings, a severely limited procedure. We developed a system that allows to automatically identify diagnostic labelling error from diagnoses coded according to the international classification of diseases (ICD), often available as routine health care data. METHODS: The system developed (index test) was validated against rater based classifications taken from three previous studies of diagnostic labeling error (reference standard). The system compares pairs of diagnoses through calculation of their distance within the ICD taxonomy. Calculation is based on four different algorithms. To assess the concordance between index test and reference standard, we calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) and corresponding confidence intervals. Analysis were conducted overall and separately per algorithm and type of available dataset. RESULTS: Diagnoses of 1,127 cases were analyzed. Raters previously classified 24.58% of cases as diagnostic labelling errors (ranging from 12.3 to 87.2% in the three datasets). AUROC ranged between 0.821 and 0.837 overall, depending on the algorithm used to calculate the index test (95% CIs ranging from 0.8 to 0.86). Analyzed per type of dataset separately, the highest AUROC was 0.924 (95% CI 0.887-0.962). CONCLUSIONS: The trigger system to automatically identify diagnostic labeling error from routine health care data performs excellent, and is unaffected by the reference standards' limitations. It is however only applicable to cases with pairs of diagnoses, of which one must be more accurate or otherwise superior than the other, reflecting a prevalent definition of a diagnostic labeling error.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the amount of formal instruction and evaluation about reporting given to radiology residents in the U.S.A., to document report generation methods and to quantify the performance of physician coding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: E-mail requests with links to a web-based, anonymous survey were sent to program directors of all accredited radiology residencies in the USA. Demographic questions included university or private affiliation, number of residents, geographic location, and number of hospitals covered. Subject-specific items covered the amount of didactic instruction, formal evaluation of reports, and use of structured reports. A didactic activity index (DAI) was calculated as the sum of answers to domain-specific questions and tested for relation to demographic variables. We also asked about dictation methods and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) coding of examinations by radiologists. RESULTS: Of the 191 active radiology residencies, 151 (79%) completed the survey. Responses for hours of didactic instruction in reporting given more than a 4-year residency were distributed as follows: 0-1 = 40%, 2-4 = 46%, >4 = 14%. The percentage of resident reports formally graded was distributed as follows: 0-1 = 82%, 2-4 = 8%, >4 = 10%. The extent to which faculty-designed, structured reports were used by residents was distributed as follows: none = 16%, minimal = 25%, few = 17%, some = 33%, most = 9%. The DAI was normally distributed with a mean of 14.8 and a standard deviation of 2.4. Military programs had higher DAIs than university residencies (P = .03). There was no significant relation between any other program demographic variables and the DAI (P > .05). A substantial number of programs reported that physicians performed coding for some or most studies: ICD-9 = 30%, CPT = 26%. The dominant method for report generation was human transcription in 79% followed by speech recognition at 19%. Speech recognition penetration (departments reporting use of the technology for at least some dictation) was estimated to be 38%. CONCLUSION: In 86% of sampled radiology residencies, trainees receive no more than one hour of didactic instruction in radiology reporting per year. An aggregate measure of didactic activity about interpretative reporting was identical across all program demographic variables except that military residencies seemed to do slightly more than those located at universities.

AB  - PURPOSE: Given the 2015 transition to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnostic coding, updates to our previously published algorithms for major structural birth defects (BDs) were necessary. Aims of this study were to update, validate, and refine algorithms for identifying selected BDs, and then to use these algorithms to describe BD prevalence in the vaccine safety datalink (VSD) population. METHODS: We converted our ICD-9-CM list of selected BDs to ICD-10-CM using available crosswalks with manual review of codes. We identified, chart reviewed, and adjudicated a sample of infants in the VSD with ≥2 ICD-10-CM diagnoses for one of seven common BDs. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated; for BDs with suboptimal PPV, algorithms were refined. Final automated algorithms were applied to a cohort of live births delivered 10/1/2015-9/30/2017 at eight VSD sites to estimate BD prevalence. This research was approved by the HealthPartners Institutional Review Board, by all participating VSD sites, and by the CDC, with a waiver of informed consent. RESULTS: Of 573 infants with ≥2 diagnoses for a targeted BD, on adjudication, we classified 399 (69.6%) as probable cases, 31 (5.4%) as possible cases and 143 (25.0%) as not having the targeted BD. PPVs for the final BD algorithms ranged from 0.76 (hypospadias) to 1.0 (gastroschisis). Among 212 857 births over 2 years following transition to ICD-10-CM coding, prevalence for the full list of selected defects in the VSD was 1.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Algorithms can identify infants with selected BDs using automated healthcare data with reasonable accuracy. Our updated algorithms can be used in observational studies of maternal vaccine safety and may be adapted for use in other surveillance systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the rate of pediatric postoperative mortality is low, the development and validation of perioperative risk assessment models have allowed for the stratification of those at highest risk, including the Pediatric Risk Assessment (PRAm) score. The clinical application of such tools requires manual data entry, which may be inaccurate or incomplete, compromise efficiency, and increase physicians' clerical obligations. We aimed to create an electronically derived, automated PRAm score and to evaluate its agreement with the original American College of Surgery National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP)-derived and validated score. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of children <18 years who underwent noncardiac surgery from 2017 through 2021 at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). An automated PRAm score was developed via electronic derivation of International Classification of Disease (ICD) -9 and -10 codes. The primary outcome was agreement and correlation among PRAm scores obtained via automation, NSQIP data, and manual physician entry from the same BCH cohort. The secondary outcome was discriminatory ability of the 3 PRAm versions. Fleiss Kappa, Spearman correlation (rho), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses with area under the curve (AUC) were applied accordingly. RESULTS: Of the 6014 patients with NSQIP and automated PRAm scores (manual scores: n = 5267), the rate of 30-day mortality was 0.18% (n = 11). Agreement and correlation were greater between the NSQIP and automated scores (rho = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.79; P <.001; ICC = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.79-0.81; Fleiss kappa = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.65-0.67) versus the NSQIP and manual scores (rho = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.71-0.74; P < .001; ICC = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.77-0.79; Fleiss kappa = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.54-0.57). ROC analysis with AUC showed the manual score to have the greatest discrimination (AUC = 0.976; 95% CI, 0.959,0.993) compared to the NSQIP (AUC = 0.904; 95% CI, 0.792-0.999) and automated (AUC = 0.880; 95% CI, 0.769-0.999) scores. CONCLUSIONS: Development of an electronically derived, automated PRAm score that maintains good discrimination for 30-day mortality in neonates, infants, and children after noncardiac surgery is feasible. The automated PRAm score may reduce the preoperative clerical workload and provide an efficient and accurate means by which to risk stratify neonatal and pediatric surgical patients with the goal of improving clinical outcomes and resource utilization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Clinical Classification Software Refined (CCSR) is a tool that groups many thousands of International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes into approximately 500 clinically meaningful categories, simplifying analyses. However, CCSR was developed for use in the United States and may not work well with other country-specific ICD-10 coding systems. METHOD: We developed an algorithm for semi-automated matching of Canadian ICD-10 codes (ICD-10-CA) to CCSR categories using discharge diagnoses from adult admissions at 7 hospitals between Apr 1, 2010 and Dec 31, 2020, and manually validated the results. We then externally validated our approach using inpatient hospital encounters in Denmark from 2017 to 2018. KEY RESULTS: There were 383,972 Canadian hospital admissions with 5,186 distinct ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes and 1,855,837 Danish encounters with 4,612 ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Only 46.6% of Canadian codes and 49.4% of Danish codes could be directly categorized using the official CCSR tool. Our algorithm facilitated the mapping of 98.5% of all Canadian codes and 97.7% of Danish codes. Validation of our algorithm by clinicians demonstrated excellent accuracy (97.1% and 97.0% in Canadian and Danish data, respectively). Without our algorithm, many common conditions did not match directly to a CCSR category, such as 96.6% of hospital admissions for heart failure. CONCLUSION: The GEMINI CCSR matching algorithm (available as an open-source package at https://github.com/GEMINI-Medicine/gemini-ccsr) improves the categorization of Canadian and Danish ICD-10 codes into clinically coherent categories compared to the original CCSR tool. We expect this approach to generalize well to other countries and enable a wide range of research and quality measurement applications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Unstructured data present in electronic health records (EHR) are a rich source of medical information; however, their abstraction is labor intensive. Automated EHR phenotyping (AEP) can reduce the need for manual chart review. We present an AEP model that is designed to automatically identify patients diagnosed with epilepsy. METHODS: The ground truth for model training and evaluation was captured from a combination of structured questionnaires filled out by physicians for a subset of patients and manual chart review using customized software. Modeling features included indicators of the presence of keywords and phrases in unstructured clinical notes, prescriptions for antiseizure medications (ASMs), International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for seizures and epilepsy, number of ASMs and epilepsy-related ICD codes, age, and sex. Data were randomly divided into training (70%) and hold-out testing (30%) sets, with distinct patients in each set. We trained regularized logistic regression and an extreme gradient boosting models. Model performance was measured using area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) estimated via bootstrapping. RESULTS: Our study cohort included 3903 adults drawn from outpatient departments of nine hospitals between February 2015 and June 2022 (mean age = 47 ± 18 years, 57% women, 82% White, 84% non-Hispanic, 70% with epilepsy). The final models included 285 features, including 246 keywords and phrases captured from 8415 encounters. Both models achieved AUROC and AUPRC of 1 (95% CI = .99-1.00) in the hold-out testing set. SIGNIFICANCE: A machine learning-based AEP approach accurately identifies patients with epilepsy from notes, ICD codes, and ASMs. This model can enable large-scale epilepsy research using EHR databases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study provides an up-to-date diagnosis framework for the study of emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. A final list of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes was the main outcome for the study. Codes were compared with the number codes generated by MapIT alone. BACKGROUND: Since transition to ICD-10, a Delphi process to define EGS diagnoses, as originally described for the ICD, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codeset, has not been performed. Automated mapping software (MapIT) has been utilized, with a few studies verifying the translation. METHODS: Using previously defined ICD-9 EGS codes, MapIT was used to identify ICD-10 EGS codes. Review of adjacent codes in a Delphi process resulted in a finalized list of ICD-10 codes. Delphi and MapIT codes were quantified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to compare rates to the ICD-9 era. RESULTS: MapIT identified 935 ICD-10 codes from 485 ICD-9 codes. Manual review identified an additional 1907 adjacent codes. In total, after the modified Delphi process, 1579 (55.6%) of manually and MapIT-identified codes were included in the final codeset. After initial mapping, 880 (55.7%) of the final codes did not automatically map through the software. MapIT codes resulted in a significantly decreased number of patient encounters in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample compared with Delphi codes in the ICD-10 era. CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi-created ICD-10 EGS codeset provides a more robust, accurate translation of the ICD-9 codes than MapIT software. This codeset can be used to inform EGS research to study and improve EGS patients' care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To convert the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Quality Indicators (QIs) from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) specifications to ICD, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification and Procedure Classification System (ICD-10-CM/PCS) specifications. DATA SOURCES: ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM/PCS classifications, General Equivalence Maps (GEMs). STUDY DESIGN: We convened 77 clinicians and coders to evaluate ICD-10-CM/PCS codes mapped from ICD-9-CM using automated GEMs. We reviewed codes to develop "legacy" specifications resembling those in ICD-9-CM and "enhanced" specifications addressing enhanced capabilities of ICD-10-CM/PCS. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: We tabulated the numbers of mapped codes, added nonmapped codes, and deleted mapped codes to achieve the specifications. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 212 clinical concepts (sets of codes) that comprise the QI specifications, we either added nonmapped codes to or deleted mapped codes from 115 (54 percent). The legacy and enhanced specifications differed for 46 sets (22 percent), affecting 67 of the 101 QIs (66 percent). Occasionally, concepts that defied conversion required reformulation of indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Converting the AHRQ QIs to ICD-10-CM/PCS required a detailed, thorough process beyond automated mapping of codes. Differences between the legacy and enhanced versions of the QIs are frequently minor but sometimes substantive.

METHODS: We study ICD9 diagnosis codes and discharge summaries from the publicly available Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC II) repository. We experiment with two coding approaches: one that treats each ICD9 code independently of each other (flat classifier), and one that leverages the hierarchical nature of ICD9 codes into its modeling (hierarchy-based classifier). We propose novel evaluation metrics, which reflect the distances among gold-standard and predicted codes and their locations in the ICD9 tree. Experimental setup, code for modeling, and evaluation scripts are made available to the research community. RESULTS: The hierarchy-based classifier outperforms the flat classifier with F-measures of 39.5% and 27.6%, respectively, when trained on 20,533 documents and tested on 2282 documents. While recall is improved at the expense of precision, our novel evaluation metrics show a more refined assessment: for instance, the hierarchy-based classifier identifies the correct sub-tree of gold-standard codes more often than the flat classifier. Error analysis reveals that gold-standard codes are not perfect, and as such the recall and precision are likely underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: Hierarchy-based classification yields better ICD9 coding than flat classification for MIMIC patients. Automated ICD9 coding is an example of a task for which data and tools can be shared and for which the research community can work together to build on shared models and advance the state of the art.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Correct certification of cause of death by physicians (i.e. completing the medical certificate of cause of death or MCCOD) and correct coding according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) rules are essential to produce quality mortality statistics to inform health policy. Despite clear guidelines, errors in medical certification are common. This study objectively measures the impact of different medical certification errors upon the selection of the underlying cause of death. METHODS: A sample of 1592 error-free MCCODs were selected from the 2017 United States multiple cause of death data. The ten most common types of errors in completing the MCCOD (according to published studies) were individually simulated on the error-free MCCODs. After each simulation, the MCCODs were coded using Iris automated mortality coding software. Chance-corrected concordance (CCC) was used to measure the impact of certification errors on the underlying cause of death. Weights for each error type and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) group (representing different mortality conditions) were calculated from the CCC and categorised (very high, high, medium and low) to describe their effect on cause of death accuracy. FINDINGS: The only very high impact error type was reporting an ill-defined condition as the underlying cause of death. High impact errors were found to be reporting competing causes in Part 1 [of the death certificate] and illegibility, with medium impact errors being reporting underlying cause in Part 2 [of the death certificate], incorrect or absent time intervals and reporting contributory causes in Part 1, and low impact errors comprising multiple causes per line and incorrect sequence. There was only small difference in error importance between SDI groups. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting an ill-defined condition as the underlying cause of death can seriously affect the coding outcome, while other certification errors were mitigated through the correct application of mortality coding rules. Training of physicians in not reporting ill-defined conditions on the MCCOD and mortality coders in correct coding practices and using Iris should be important components of national strategies to improve cause of death data quality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and evaluate effective methods that can normalize diagnosis and procedure terms written by physicians to standard concepts in International Classification of Diseases(ICD) in Chinese, with the goal to facilitate automated medical coding in China. METHODS: We applied the entity-linking framework to normalize Chinese diagnosis and procedure terms, which consists of two steps - candidate concept generation and candidate concept ranking. For candidate concept generation, we implemented both the traditional BM25 algorithm and an extended version that integrates a synonym knowledgebase. For candidate concept ranking, we investigated a number of different algorithms: (1) the BM25 algorithm, (2) ranking support vector machines (RankSVM), (3) a previously reported Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach, (4) 11 deep ranking-based methods from the MatchZoo toolkit, and (5) a new BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) based ranking method. Using two manually annotated datasets (8,547 diagnoses and 8,282 procedures) collected from a Tier 3A hospital in China, we evaluated above methods and reported their performance (i.e., accuracy) at different cutoffs. RESULTS: The coverage of candidate concept generation was greatly improved after integrating the synonym knowledgebase, achieving 97.9% for diagnoses and 93.4% for procedures respectively. Overall the new BERT-based ranking method achieved the best performance on both diagnosis and procedure normalization, with the best accuracy of 92.1% for diagnosis and 80.1% for procedure, when the top one concept and exact match criteria were used. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed and compared diverse entity-linking methods to normalize clinical terms in Chinese and our evaluation shows good performance on mapping disease terms to ICD codes, demonstrating the feasibility of automated encoding of clinical terms in Chinese.

AB  - PURPOSE: To review the evidence supporting the validity of billing, procedural, or diagnosis code, or pharmacy claim-based algorithms used to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in administrative and claim databases. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE database from 1991 to September 2012 using controlled vocabulary and key terms related to RA and reference lists of included studies were searched. Two investigators independently assessed the full text of studies against pre-determined inclusion criteria and extracted the data. Data collected included participant and algorithm characteristics. RESULTS: Nine studies reported validation of computer algorithms based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes with or without free-text, medication use, laboratory data and the need for a diagnosis by a rheumatologist. These studies yielded positive predictive values (PPV) ranging from 34 to 97% to identify patients with RA. Higher PPVs were obtained with the use of at least two ICD and/or procedure codes (ICD-9 code 714 and others), the requirement of a prescription of a medication used to treat RA, or requirement of participation of a rheumatologist in patient care. For example, the PPV increased from 66 to 97% when the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and the presence of a positive rheumatoid factor were required. CONCLUSIONS: There have been substantial efforts to propose and validate algorithms to identify patients with RA in automated databases. Algorithms that include more than one code and incorporate medications or laboratory data and/or required a diagnosis by a rheumatologist may increase the PPV.

AB  - Disease coding is the process of assigning one or more standardized diagnostic codes to clinical notes that are maintained by health practitioners (e.g. clinicians) to track patient condition. Such a coding process is often expensive and error-prone, as human medical coders primarily perform it. Automating diagnostic coding using Artificial Intelligence is seen as an essential solution in Hospital Information Management Systems and approaches built on Convolutional Neural Networks currently perform best. In this work, a neural model built on unstructured clinical text for enabling automatic diagnostic coding for given patient discharge summaries is proposed. We incorporate a structured self-attention mechanism designed to boost learning of label-specific vectors and the significant clinical text snippets associated with a certain label for this purpose. These vectors are then combined with a novel code description pipeline leveraging the descriptions provided for each standardized diagnostic code. The proposed model achieved best performance in terms of standard metrics over the MIMIC-III dataset, outperforming models based on Longformers and Knowledge graphs. Furthermore, to leverage structured clinical data to enhance the proposed model, and to enable improved diagnostic code prediction, model ensembling is considered. A neural model built on structured data by leveraging supervised machine learning algorithms such as random forest and boosting, is designed for multi-class code classification. Experimental results revealed that the proposed ensemble models show promising performance compared to traditional models that rely solely on unstructured or structured clinical data, emphasizing their suitability for real-world deployment.

AB  - Robotic surgery has become increasingly prevalent in general surgery practice. While previous studies have shown the safety and efficacy of robotic assistance in laparoscopic general surgery procedures, few studies have evaluated the temporal and regional trends in implementation. In our retrospective population-based study, we aim to evaluate the national trends in robotic surgery. National Inpatient Database (NIS 2009-2014) was used to identify adults who underwent robotic assisted surgery (ICD 9 codes 17.41 to 17.49). Robotic procedures related to seven abdominal organ systems were compared against the trends of Urology, Gynaecologic, and Orthopedic robotic procedures. Discharge weights were applied to calculate National temporal trends separated by hospital size, teaching status and US geographic region. 894,163 patients received a robotic assisted procedure between 2009 and 2014 with 64% increase in utilization. The largest percent change was witnessed in biliary robotic procedures with 2984% change in utilization, followed by hernia (1376%). Lowest percent change was witnessed in esophageal procedures with 114% increase. Medium sized hospitals had the largest change in robotic utilization (41%), with large institutions seeing 18% decrease. Gastric procedures were the most common robotic procedure performed at small institutions (7917 total cases; 316%). Large institutions saw an overall decrease in gastric (- 47%), esophageal (- 17%), small and large intestinal (-16%), and hepatic (- 7%) robotic procedures. Rural non-teaching hospitals saw the largest increase in robotic surgery (274%). Urban non-teaching hospitals saw a decrease of 29%. While urban teaching institutions saw a 20% and 6% increase in gynecological and urological procedures, an overall decrease was seen in esophageal (- 10%), gastric (- 12%), intestinal (- 11%), hepatic (- 17%), biliary (- 10%), pancreatic (- 11%) and hernia procedures (- 14%). Biliary procedures saw the largest increase in rural institutions (740 cases; 392%), followed by hernia (144% increase). South region of the nation had the largest increase in robotic procedures (23%). No change was seen in the use of robotic surgery in the northeast region with the midwest and west seeing an overall decrease (- 4% and - 22%, respectively). Our study highlights the increase in use of robotics for both general and specialty surgery, with an increase in utilization over time. Increased incidence of robotic surgery in smaller, rural institutions with overall decrease in larger, urban teaching hospitals suggests increasing comfort in robotic surgery in the community setting. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the factors associated with increased utilization in smaller institutions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wikipedia is a popular encyclopedia for health- and disease-related information in which patients seek advice and guidance on the web. Yet, Wikipedia articles can be unsuitable as patient education materials, as investigated in previous studies that analyzed specific diseases or medical topics with a comparatively small sample size. Currently, no data are available on the average readability levels of all disease-related Wikipedia pages for the different localizations of this particular encyclopedia. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze disease-related Wikipedia pages written in English, German, and Russian using well-established readability metrics for each language. METHODS: Wikipedia database snapshots and Wikidata metadata were chosen as resources for data collection. Disease-related articles were retrieved separately for English, German, and Russian starting with the main concept of Human Diseases and Disorders (German: Krankheit; Russian: Заболевания человека). In the case of existence, the corresponding International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), codes were retrieved for each article. Next, the raw texts were extracted and readability metrics were computed. RESULTS: The number of articles included in this study for English, German, and Russian Wikipedia was n=6127, n=6024, and n=3314, respectively. Most disease-related articles had a Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) score <50.00, signaling difficult or very difficult educational material (English: 5937/6125, 96.93%; German: 6004/6022, 99.7%; Russian: 2647/3313, 79.9%). In total, 70% (7/10) of the analyzed articles could be assigned an ICD-10 code with certainty (English: 4235/6127, 69.12%; German: 4625/6024, 76.78%; Russian: 2316/3314, 69.89%). For articles with ICD-10 codes, the mean FRE scores were 28.69 (SD 11.00), 20.33 (SD 9.98), and 38.54 (SD 13.51) for English, German, and Russian, respectively. A total of 9 English ICD-10 chapters (11 German and 10 Russian) showed significant differences: chapter F (FRE 23.88, SD 9.95; P<.001), chapter E (FRE 25.14, SD 9.88; P<.001), chapter H (FRE 30.04, SD 10.57; P=.049), chapter I (FRE 30.05, SD 9.07; P=.04), chapter M (FRE 31.17, 11.94; P<.001), chapter T (FRE 32.06, SD 10.51; P=.001), chapter A (FRE 32.63, SD 9.25; P<.001), chapter B (FRE 33.24, SD 9.07; P<.001), and chapter S (FRE 39.02, SD 8.22; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Disease-related English, German, and Russian Wikipedia articles cannot be recommended as patient education materials because a major fraction is difficult or very difficult to read. The authors of Wikipedia pages should carefully revise existing text materials for readers with a specific interest in a disease or its associated symptoms. Special attention should be given to articles on mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders (ICD-10 chapter F) because these articles were most difficult to read in comparison with other ICD-10 chapters. Wikipedia readers should be supported by editors providing a short and easy-to-read summary for each article.

AB  - Unstructured clinical narratives are continuously being recorded as part of delivery of care in electronic health records, and dedicated tagging staff spend considerable effort manually assigning clinical codes for billing purposes. Despite these efforts, however, label availability and accuracy are both suboptimal. In this retrospective study, we aimed to automate the assignment of top-level International Classification of Diseases version 9 (ICD-9) codes to clinical records from human and veterinary data stores using minimal manual labor and feature curation. Automating top-level annotations could in turn enable rapid cohort identification, especially in a veterinary setting. To this end, we trained long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on 52,722 human and 89,591 veterinary records. We investigated the accuracy of both separate-domain and combined-domain models and probed model portability. We established relevant baseline classification performances by training Decision Trees (DT) and Random Forests (RF). We also investigated whether transforming the data using MetaMap Lite, a clinical natural language processing tool, affected classification performance. We showed that the LSTM-RNNs accurately classify veterinary and human text narratives into top-level categories with an average weighted macro F1 score of 0.74 and 0.68 respectively. In the "neoplasia" category, the model trained on veterinary data had a high validation accuracy in veterinary data and moderate accuracy in human data, with F1 scores of 0.91 and 0.70 respectively. Our LSTM method scored slightly higher than that of the DT and RF models. The use of LSTM-RNN models represents a scalable structure that could prove useful in cohort identification for comparative oncology studies. Digitization of human and veterinary health information will continue to be a reality, particularly in the form of unstructured narratives. Our approach is a step forward for these two domains to learn from and inform one another.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS) is a devastating form of acute kidney injury (AKI) in advanced liver disease patients with high morbidity and mortality, but phenotyping algorithms have not yet been developed using large electronic health record (EHR) databases. We evaluated and compared multiple phenotyping methods to achieve an accurate algorithm for HRS identification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A national retrospective cohort of patients with cirrhosis and AKI admitted to 124 Veterans Affairs hospitals was assembled from electronic health record data collected from 2005 to 2013. AKI was defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Five hundred and four hospitalizations were selected for manual chart review and served as the gold standard. Electronic Health Record based predictors were identified using structured and free text clinical data, subjected through NLP from the clinical Text Analysis Knowledge Extraction System. We explored several dimension reduction techniques for the NLP data, including newer high-throughput phenotyping and word embedding methods, and ascertained their effectiveness in identifying the phenotype without structured predictor variables. With the combined structured and NLP variables, we analyzed five phenotyping algorithms: penalized logistic regression, naïve Bayes, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting. Calibration and discrimination metrics were calculated using 100 bootstrap iterations. In the final model, we report odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the different models ranged from 0.73 to 0.93; with penalized logistic regression having the best discriminatory performance. Calibration for logistic regression was modest, but gradient boosting and support vector machines were superior. NLP identified 6985 variables; a priori variable selection performed similarly to dimensionality reduction using high-throughput phenotyping and semantic similarity informed clustering (AUC of 0.81 - 0.82). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated improved phenotyping of a challenging AKI etiology, HRS, over ICD-9 coding. We also compared performance among multiple approaches to EHR-derived phenotyping, and found similar results between methods. Lastly, we showed that automated NLP dimension reduction is viable for acute illness.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The UK Biobank provides a rich collection of longitudinal clinical data coming from different healthcare providers and sources in England, Wales, and Scotland. Although extremely valuable and available to a wide research community, the heterogeneous dataset contains inconsistent medical terminology that is either aligned to several ontologies within the same category or unprocessed. To make these data useful to a research community, data cleaning, curation, and standardization are needed. Significant efforts to perform data reformatting, mapping to any selected ontologies (such as SNOMED-CT) and harmonization are required from any data user to integrate UK Biobank hospital inpatient and self-reported data, data from various registers with primary care (GP) data. The integrated clinical data would provide a more comprehensive picture of one's medical history. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated several approaches to map GP clinical Read codes to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) terminologies. The results were compared, mapping inconsistencies were flagged, a quality category was assigned to each mapping to evaluate overall mapping quality. RESULTS: We propose a curation and data integration pipeline for harmonizing diagnosis. We also report challenges identified in mapping Read codes from UK Biobank GP tables to ICD and SNOMED CT. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Some of the challenges-the lack of precise one-to-one mapping between ontologies or the need for additional ontology to fully map terms-are general reflecting trade-offs to be made at different steps. Other challenges are due to automatic mapping and can be overcome by leveraging existing mappings, supplemented with automated and manual curation.

AB  - In oncology, the reuse of data is confronted with the heterogeneity of terminologies. It is necessary to semantically integrate these distinct terminologies. The semantic integration by using a third terminology as a support is a conventional approach for the integration of two terminologies that are not very structured. The aim of our study was to use SNOMED CT for integrating ICD-10 and ICD-O3. We used two complementary resources, mapping tables provided by SNOMED CT and the NCI Metathesaurus, in order to find mappings between ICD-10 or ICD-O3 concepts and SNOMED CT concepts. We used the SNOMED CT structure to filter inconsistent mappings, as well as to disambiguate multiple mappings. Based on the remaining mappings, we used semantic relations from SNOMED CT to establish links between ICD-10 and ICD-O3. Overall, the coverage of ICD-O3 and ICD10 codes was over 88%. Finally, we obtained an integration of 24% (203/852) of ICD-10 concepts with 86% (888/1032) of ICD-O3 morphology concepts combined to 39% (127/330) of ICD-O3 topography concepts. Comparing our results with the 23,684 ICD-O3 pairs mapped to ICD-10 concepts in the SEER conversion file, we found 17,447 pairs of ICD-O3 concepts in common among which 11,932 pairs were integrated with the same ICD-10 concept as the SEER conversion file. The automated process leverages logical definitions of SNOMED CT concepts. While the low quality of some of these definitions impacted negatively the integration process, the identification of such situations made it possible to indirectly audit the structure of SNOMED CT.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with activated PI3Kδ syndrome (APDS) may elude diagnoses for nearly a decade. Methods to hasten the identification of these patients, and other patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEIs), are needed. We sought to demonstrate that querying electronic health record (EHR) systems by aggregating disparate signs into a risk score can identify these patients. METHODS: We developed a structured query language (SQL) script using literature-validated APDS-associated clinical concepts mapped to  RESULTS: The query identified all but one known patient with APDS (98%; 45/46) as well as patients with other complex disease. Median score for all patients with APDS was 9 (IQR = 5.75; range 1-25). Sensitivity analysis suggested an optimal cutoff score of 7 (sensitivity = 0.70). CONCLUSION: Disease-specific queries are a relatively simple method to foster patient identification across the rare-disease spectrum. Such methods are even more important for disorders such as APDS where an approved, pathway-specific treatment is available in the US.

AB  - Surveillance for health care-associated infections (HAIs) using administrative data has received attention from health care epidemiologists searching for efficient means to track infections in their institutions. Several states are also considering electronic surveillance that incorporates administrative data as a means to satisfy an increasing demand for mandatory public reporting of HAIs. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) discharge diagnosis codes have attributes that make them suitable for detecting HAIs; for example, they may facilitate automated surveillance, freeing up infection control personnel to perform other important tasks, such as staff education and outbreak investigation. However, controversy surrounds the appropriate use of ICD-9-CM data in detecting HAIs, and administrative coding data have been criticized for lacking elements necessary for surveillance. Administrative coding data are inappropriate as the sole means of HAI surveillance but may have value to the health care epidemiologist as a way to augment traditional methods.

AB  - AIMS: Patients hospitalized for heart failure (HF) are at increased risk for events post-discharge. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) improve the clinical course of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. We assessed MRA use in high-risk patients following an HF hospitalization to determine rate of MRA prescription, likelihood of drug continuation post-discharge, reasons for discontinuation, and association between MRA maintenance and outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients admitted to our hospital system between 2011 and 2013 were identified retrospectively through automated search of electronic medical records for appropriate ICD 9 and 10 codes. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, New York Heart Association class III-IV symptoms, >1 year of follow-up and no contraindication to MRA use were included. Of 271 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 105 (38.7%) were prescribed an MRA on discharge from index admission. Over a median follow-up of 3.12 ± 0.09 years, 70 (66.7%) continued MRA therapy, while 35 (33.3%) discontinued MRA therapy. Hyperkalemia, which occurred in 43 of the 105 patients (40.1%), was the most frequent cause of MRA discontinuation. Patients who maintained MRA therapy had significantly less all-cause, cardiovascular, and HF hospitalizations and significantly better survival compared with those who discontinued drug. CONCLUSIONS: A minority of HF with reduced ejection fraction patients who were eligible for an MRA received them following HF hospitalization and nearly a third of them discontinued drug. Patients who discontinued an MRA were more likely to be hospitalized or die during follow-up. These findings indicate a need for better strategies to increase MRA prescription and maintain therapy following a hospitalization for HF.

AB  - Inconsistent disease coding standards in medicine create hurdles in data exchange and analysis. This paper proposes a machine learning system to address this challenge. The system automatically matches unstructured medical text (doctor notes, complaints) to ICD-10 codes. It leverages a unique architecture featuring a training layer for model development and a knowledge base that captures relationships between symptoms and diseases. Experiments using data from a large medical research center demonstrated the system's effectiveness in disease classification prediction. Logistic regression emerged as the optimal model due to its superior processing speed, achieving an accuracy of 81.07% with acceptable error rates during high-load testing. This approach offers a promising solution to improve healthcare informatics by overcoming coding standard incompatibility and automating code prediction from unstructured medical text.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes play a critical role as fundamental data for hospital management and can significantly impact diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). This study investigated the quality issues associated with ICD data and their impact on improper DRG payments. METHODS: Our study analyzed data from a Chinese hospital from 2016-2017 to evaluate the impact of ICD data quality on Chinese Diagnosis-related Group (CN-DRG) evaluation variables and payments. We assessed different stages of the ICD generation process and established a standardized process for evaluating ICD data quality and relevant indicators. The validation of the data quality assessment (DQA) was confirmed through sampling data. RESULTS: This study of 85,522 inpatient charts found that gynecology had the highest and obstetrics had the lowest diagnosis agreement rates. Pediatrics had the highest agreement rates for MDC and DRG, while neonatal pediatrics had the lowest. The Case Mix Index (CMI) of Coder-coded data showed to be more reasonable than physician-coded data, with increased DRG payments in obstetrics and gynecology. The DQA model revealed coding errors ranging from 40.3 percent to 65.1 percent for physician and 12.2 percent to 23.6 percent for coder. Payment discrepancies were observed, with physicians resulting in underpayment and coders displaying overpayment in some cases. CONCLUSION: ICD data is crucial for effective healthcare management, and implementing standardized and automated processes to assess ICD data quality can improve data accuracy. This enhances the ability to make reasonable DRG payments and accurately reflects the quality of healthcare management.

AB  - Computer-based patient data which are represented in a coded form have a variety of uses, including direct patient care, statistical reporting, automated decision support, and clinical research. No standard exists which supports all of these functions. Abstracting coding systems, such as ICD, CPT, DRGs and MeSH fail to provide adequate detail, forcing application developers to create their own coding schemes for systems. Some of these schemes have been put forward as possible standards, but they have not been widely accepted. This paper reviews existing schemes used for abstracting, electronic record systems, and comprehensive coding. It also discusses the remaining impediments to acceptance of standards and the current efforts to overcome them, including SNOMED, the Gabrieli Medical Nomenclature, the Read Clinical Codes, GALEN, and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).

AB  - The common coding of main diagnosis (so-called "manual coding") is accompanied by quite many errors associated with inobservance of classification algorithm and subjective causes that in statistical morbidity and mortality data corruption. The article presents the results of implementing automated system of diagnosis coding by the ICD-10 in the departments of the Medicosanitary Unit of MVD of Russia in City of Moscow. The functional and time losses and the error rate were studied under manual coding and automated coding system. In case of common coding of complete clinical diagnosis of one discharged patient per day, it takes from 5 to 15 minutes, for coding diagnoses of all discharged patients - about 1 hour. The number of errors in common coding made up to 14.1% (n=2472) and in case of automated coding it made up to 1.5% (n= 63, p>0.05). The application of automated coding system in medical organizations ensures exact correspondence of clinical and statistical diagnosis, unifies wording of clinical diagnosis, minimizes subjective deviations from algorithm of the ICD-10.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Unstructured and structured data in electronic health records (EHR) are a rich source of information for research and quality improvement studies. However, extracting accurate information from EHR is labor-intensive. Here we introduce an automated EHR phenotyping model to identify patients with Alzheimer's Disease, related dementias (ADRD), or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We assembled medical notes and associated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and medication prescriptions from 3,626 outpatient adults from two hospitals seen between February 2015 and June 2022. Ground truth annotations regarding the presence vs. absence of a diagnosis of MCI or ADRD were determined through manual chart review. Indicators extracted from notes included the presence of keywords and phrases in unstructured clinical notes, prescriptions of medications associated with MCI/ADRD, and ICD codes associated with MCI/ADRD. We trained a regularized logistic regression model to predict the ground truth annotations. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), accuracy, specificity, precision/positive predictive value, recall/sensitivity, and F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall). RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients in the cohort carried diagnoses of MCI/ADRD based on manual review. When evaluated on a held-out test set, the best model using clinical notes, ICDs, and medications, achieved an AUROC of 0.98, an AUPRC of 0.98, an accuracy of 0.93, a sensitivity (recall) of 0.91, a specificity of 0.96, a precision of 0.96, and an F1 score of 0.93 The estimated overall accuracy for patients randomly selected from EHRs was 99.88%. CONCLUSION: Automated EHR phenotyping accurately identifies patients with MCI/ADRD based on clinical notes, ICD codes, and medication records. This approach holds potential for large-scale MCI/ADRD research utilizing EHR databases.

AB  - PURPOSE: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain a vast amount of clinical data. Improved automated classification approaches have the potential to accurately and efficiently identify patient cohorts for research. We evaluated if a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm using clinical notes performed better for classifying proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) severity compared with International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition (ICD-9) or 10th edition (ICD-10) codes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: Deidentified EHR data from an academic medical center identified 2366 patients aged ≥18 years, with diabetes mellitus, diabetic retinopathy (DR), and available clinical notes. METHODS: From these 2366 patients, 306 random patients (100 training set, 206 test set) underwent chart review by ophthalmologists to establish the gold standard. International Classification of Diseases codes were extracted from the EHR. The notes algorithm identified positive mention of PDR and NPDR severity from clinical notes. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy and NPDR severity classification by ICD codes and the notes algorithm were compared with the gold standard. The entire DR cohort (N = 2366) was then classified as having presence (or absence) of PDR using ICD codes and the notes algorithm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and F1 score for the notes algorithm compared with ICD codes using a gold standard of chart review. RESULTS: For PDR classification of the test set patients, the notes algorithm performed better than ICD codes for all metrics. Specifically, the notes algorithm had significantly higher sensitivity (90.5% [95% confidence interval 85.7, 94.9] vs. 68.4% [60.4, 75.3]), but similar PPV (98.0% [95.4-100] vs. 94.7% [90.3, 98.3]) respectively. The F1 score was 0.941 [0.910, 0.966] for the notes algorithm compared with 0.794 [0.734, 0.842] for ICD codes. For PDR classification, ICD-10 codes performed better than ICD-9 codes (F1 score 0.836 [0.771, 0.878] vs. 0.596 [0.222, 0.692]). For NPDR severity classification, the notes algorithm performed similarly to ICD codes, but performance was limited by small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: The notes algorithm outperformed ICD codes for PDR classification. The findings demonstrate the significant potential of applying a rule-based NLP algorithm to clinical notes to increase the efficiency and accuracy of cohort selection for research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Administrative codes to identify people with rare epilepsies in electronic health records are limited. The current study evaluated the use of keyword search as an alternative method for rare epilepsy cohort creation using electronic health records data. METHODS: Data included clinical notes from encounters with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for seizures, epilepsy, and/or convulsions during 2010-2014, across six health care systems in New York City. We identified cases with rare epilepsies by searching clinical notes for keywords associated with 33 rare epilepsies. We validated cases via manual chart review. We compared the performance of keyword search to manual chart review using positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and F-score. We selected an initial combination of keywords using the highest F-scores. RESULTS: Data included clinical notes from 77 924 cases with ICD-9 codes for seizures, epilepsy, and/or convulsions. The all-keyword search method identified 6095 candidates, and manual chart review confirmed that 2068 (34%) had a rare epilepsy. The initial combination method identified 1862 cases with a rare epilepsy, and this method performed as follows: PPV median = .64 (interquartile range [IQR] = .50-.81, range = .20-1.00), sensitivity median = .93 (IQR = .76-1.00, range = .10-1.00), and F-score median = .71 (IQR = .63-.85, range = .18-1.00). Using this method, we identified four cohorts of rare epilepsies with over 100 individuals, including infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Rett syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex. We identified over 50 individuals with two rare epilepsies that do not have specific ICD-10 codes for cohort creation (epilepsy with myoclonic atonic seizures, Sturge-Weber syndrome). SIGNIFICANCE: Keyword search is an effective method for cohort creation. These findings can improve identification and surveillance of individuals with rare epilepsies and promote their referral to specialty clinics, clinical research, and support groups.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Unstructured and structured data in electronic health records (EHR) are a rich source of information for research and quality improvement studies. However, extracting accurate information from EHR is labor-intensive. Timely and accurate identification of patients with Alzheimer's Disease, related dementias (ADRD), or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is critical for improving patient outcomes through early intervention, optimizing care plans, and reducing healthcare system burdens. Here we introduce an automated EHR phenotyping model to streamline this process and enable efficient identification of these conditions. METHODS: We analyzed data from 3,626 outpatients seen at two hospitals between February 2015 and June 2022. Through manual chart review, we established ground truth labels for the presence or absence of MCI/ADRD diagnoses. Our model combined three types of data: (1) unstructured clinical notes, from which we extracted single words, two-word phrases (bigrams), and three-word phrases (trigrams) as features, weighted using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to capture their relative importance, (2) International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and (3) medication prescriptions related to MCI/ADRD. We trained a regularized logistic regression model to predict MCI/ADRD diagnoses and evaluated its performance using standard metrics including area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), accuracy, specificity, precision, recall, and F1 score. RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients in the cohort carried diagnoses of MCI/ADRD based on manual review. When evaluated on a held-out test set, the best model using clinical notes, ICDs, and medications, achieved an AUROC of 0.98, an AUPRC of 0.98, an accuracy of 0.93, a sensitivity (recall) of 0.91, a specificity of 0.96, a precision of 0.96, and an F1 score of 0.93 The estimated overall accuracy for patients randomly selected from EHRs was 99.88%. CONCLUSION: Automated EHR phenotyping accurately identifies patients with MCI/ADRD based on clinical notes, ICD codes, and medication records. This approach holds potential for large-scale MCI/ADRD research utilizing EHR databases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 coding creates a data standardisation challenge for large-scale longitudinal research. We sought to develop a programme that automated this standardisation process. METHODS: A programme was developed to standardise ICD-9 and ICD-10 terminology into one system. Code was improved to reduce runtime, and two iterations were tested on a joint ICD-9/ICD-10 database of 15.8 million patients. RESULTS: Both programmes successfully standardised diagnostic terminology in the database. While the original programme updated 100 000 cells in 12.5 hours, the improved programme translated 3.1 million cells in 38 min. DISCUSSION: While both programmes successfully translated ICD-related data into a standardised format, the original programme suffered from excessive runtimes. Code improvement with hash tables and parallelisation exponentially reduced these runtimes. CONCLUSION: Databases with ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes require terminology standardisation for analysis. By sharing our programme's implementation, we hope to assist other researchers in standardising their own databases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium in hospitalized patients is a syndrome of acute brain dysfunction. Diagnostic (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]) codes are often used in studies using electronic health records (EHRs), but they are inaccurate. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a more accurate method using natural language processing (NLP) to detect delirium episodes on the basis of unstructured clinical notes. METHODS: We collected 1.5 million notes from >10,000 patients from among 9 hospitals. Seven experts iteratively labeled 200,471 sentences. Using these, we trained three NLP classifiers: Support Vector Machine, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Transformer. Testing was performed using an external data set. We also evaluated associations with delirium billing (ICD) codes, medications, orders for restraints and sitters, direct assessments (Confusion Assessment Method [CAM] scores), and in-hospital mortality. F1 scores, confusion matrices, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were used to compare NLP models. We used the φ coefficient to measure associations with other delirium indicators. RESULTS: The transformer NLP performed best on the following parameters: micro F1=0.978, macro F1=0.918, positive AUC=0.984, and negative AUC=0.992. NLP detections exhibited higher correlations (φ) than ICD codes with deliriogenic medications (0.194 vs 0.073 for ICD codes), restraints and sitter orders (0.358 vs 0.177), mortality (0.216 vs 0.000), and CAM scores (0.256 vs -0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical notes are an attractive alternative to ICD codes for EHR delirium studies but require automated methods. Our NLP model detects delirium with high accuracy, similar to manual chart review. Our NLP approach can provide more accurate determination of delirium for large-scale EHR-based studies regarding delirium, quality improvement, and clinical trails.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop classification algorithms that accurately identify axial SpA (axSpA) patients in electronic health records, and compare the performance of algorithms incorporating free-text data against approaches using only International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. METHODS: An enriched cohort of 7853 eligible patients was created from electronic health records of two large hospitals using automated searches (⩾1 ICD codes combined with simple text searches). Key disease concepts from free-text data were extracted using NLP and combined with ICD codes to develop algorithms. We created both supervised regression-based algorithms-on a training set of 127 axSpA cases and 423 non-cases-and unsupervised algorithms to identify patients with high probability of having axSpA from the enriched cohort. Their performance was compared against classifications using ICD codes only. RESULTS: NLP extracted four disease concepts of high predictive value: ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, HLA-B27 and spondylitis. The unsupervised algorithm, incorporating both the NLP concept and ICD code for AS, identified the greatest number of patients. By setting the probability threshold to attain 80% positive predictive value, it identified 1509 axSpA patients (mean age 53 years, 71% male). Sensitivity was 0.78, specificity 0.94 and area under the curve 0.93. The two supervised algorithms performed similarly but identified fewer patients. All three outperformed traditional approaches using ICD codes alone (area under the curve 0.80-0.87). CONCLUSION: Algorithms incorporating free-text data can accurately identify axSpA patients in electronic health records. Large cohorts identified using these novel methods offer exciting opportunities for future clinical research.

AB  - Identifying the Underlying Cause of Death accurately is crucial for effective healthcare policy and planning. The World Health Organization recommends using the ICD-10 system to standardize death certificate coding, a task often supported by semi-automated systems. This paper assesses the effectiveness of BERT and Mistral language models in automating this process, focusing particularly on their handling of varied instance densities per ICD code, ranging from 1 (simulating the introduction of a new code) to 100 (representing well-established codes). Through extensive comparative experiments, we find that the finetuned Mistral model substantially outperforms BERT, especially in scenarios with limited data. Mistral's higher effectiveness, even with limited data from less commonly used codes, highlight its potential to significantly enhance automated coding systems.

AB  - Currently, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes are being used to improve clinical, financial, and administrative performance. Inaccurate ICD coding can lower the quality of care, and delay or prevent reimbursement. However, selecting the appropriate ICD code from a patient's clinical history is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. The rapid spread of electronic medical records (EMRs) has generated a large amount of clinical data and provides an opportunity to predict ICD codes using deep learning models. The main objective of this study was to use a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) model to accurately predict ICD-10 codes, which could help providers to make better clinical decisions and improve their level of service. We retrospectively collected clinical notes from five outpatient departments (OPD) from one university teaching hospital between January 2016 and December 2016. We applied NLP techniques, including global vectors, word to vectors, and embedding techniques to process the data. The dataset was split into two independent training and testing datasets consisting of 90% and 10% of the entire dataset, respectively. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was developed, and the performance was measured using the precision, recall, and F-score. A total of 21,953 medical records were collected from 5016 patients. The performance of the CNN model for the five different departments was clinically satisfactory (Precision: 0.50~0.69 and recall: 0.78~0.91). However, the CNN model achieved the best performance for the cardiology department, with a precision of 69%, a recall of 89% and an F-score of 78%. The CNN model for predicting ICD-10 codes provides an opportunity to improve the quality of care. Implementing this model in real-world clinical settings could reduce the manual coding workload, enhance the efficiency of clinical coding, and support physicians in making better clinical decisions.

AB  - The demographic and epidemiological transitions of the past 200 years are well documented at an aggregate level. Understanding differences in individual and group risks for mortality during these transitions requires linkage between demographic data and detailed individual cause of death information. This paper describes the digitization of almost 185,000 causes of death for Ohio to supplement demographic information in the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). To extract causes of death, our methodology combines handwriting recognition, extensive data cleaning algorithms, and the semi-automated classification of causes of death into International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Our procedures are adaptable to other collections of handwritten data, which require both handwriting recognition and semi-automated coding of the information extracted.

AB  - Electronic medical records provide potential benefits and also drawbacks. Potential benefits include increased patient safety and efficiency. Potential drawbacks include newly introduced errors and diminished workflow efficiency. In the patient safety context, medication errors account for significant patient harm. Electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) offers the promise of automated drug interaction and dosage verification. In addition, the process of enabling e-prescriptions also provides access to an often unrecognized benefit, that of viewing the dispensed medication history. This information is often critical to understanding patient symptoms. Obtaining significant value from electronic medical records requires use of standardized terminology for both targeted decision support and population-based management. Further, generating documentation for a billable encounter requires usage of proper codes. The emergence of International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 holds promise in facilitating identification of a more precise patient code while also presenting drawbacks given its complexity. This article will focus on elements of e-prescribing and use of structured chart content, including diagnosis codes as they relate to physician office practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare reimbursement and coding is dependent on accurate extraction of International Classification of Diseases-tenth revision - clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) codes from clinical documentation. Attempts to automate this task have had limited success. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in extracting ICD-10-CM codes from unstructured inpatient notes and benchmark them against human coder. METHODS: This study compared performance of GPT-3.5, GPT4, Claude 2.1, Claude 3, Gemini Advanced, and Llama 2-70b in extracting ICD-10-CM codes from unstructured inpatient notes against a human coder. We presented deidentified inpatient notes from American Health Information Management Association Vlab authentic patient cases to LLMs and human coder for extraction of ICD-10-CM codes. We used a standard prompt for extracting ICD-10-CM codes. The human coder analyzed the same notes using 3M Encoder, adhering to the 2022-ICD-10-CM Coding Guidelines. RESULTS: In this study, we analyzed 50 inpatient notes, comprising of 23 history and physicals and 27 progress notes. The human coder identified 165 unique codes with a median of 4 codes per note. The LLMs extracted varying numbers of median codes per note: GPT 3.5: 7, GPT4: 6, Claude 2.1: 6, Claude 3: 8, Gemini Advanced: 5, and Llama 2-70b:11. GPT 4 had the best performance though the agreement with human coder was poor at 15.2% for overall extraction of ICD-10-CM codes and 26.4% for extraction of category ICD-10-CM codes. CONCLUSION: Current LLMs have poor performance in extraction of ICD-10-CM codes from inpatient notes when compared against a human coder.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare perioperative adverse events and reoperations between navigation-assisted and robotic-assisted posterior lumbar fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Navigation has become increasingly utilized for posterior lumbar fusion (PLF). More recently, robotic-assisted systems have been gaining traction. However, the incremental advantage of these systems has been unclear in the literature. METHODS: Patients undergoing one-level to three-level PLF (with or without anterior or posterior interbody fusion) were identified from the 2015 to 2022 M161Ortho PearlDiver Database using CPT codes. Navigation assistance was identified based on CPT coding and robotic assistance was based on ICD-10 procedural coding. Navigation-assisted cases were matched 4:1 to robotic-assisted patients based on age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, number of levels fuse, and concomitant anterior fusion. Incidence of 90-day adverse outcomes were assessed and compared with multivariable logistical regression. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple testing. Rate of reoperation was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2022, there has been a significant increase in both navigation-assisted and robotic-assisted lumbar fusions, with navigation-assisted surgery being significantly more common. After matching, there were 2401 navigation-assisted cases and 651 robotic-assisted cases. On multivariate analysis, there were no significant differences in 90-day any, severe, or minor adverse events. There was a significant increase odd of readmissions in the robotic cohort (OR: 1.77, P <0.001). There were no differences in 3-year reoperation rates between the navigation-assisted and robotic-assisted cohorts (95.8% vs. 94.0%, P =0.30). CONCLUSIONS: As spinal navigation has been gaining popularity and robotic assistance is starting to be further utilized, the incremental advantage of different techniques may be questioned. While further study and technique evolution are ongoing, the current study was not able to demonstrate 90-day or 3-year incremental advantages for robotics relative to navigation based on the metrics evaluated. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

AB  - Mortality data, by the unambiguity of their definition and understanding by all stakeholders, and completeness of registration, are a cornerstone of public health statistics in France and in most industrialized countries. This article describes the data production process, and the main types of possible analyses. Data production is composed of different stages: death certification by a medical doctor on paper or electronic (using a web application) format, data transmission to Inserm, capture and coding of information. The encoding of the information follows the WHO recommendations of the International Classification of Diseases ([ICD], 10th revision used since 2000). It is carried out using an automatic coding software, called Iris, developed in an international consortium. The coding aims, first, at assigning an ICD code to all nosologic entities encountered on the certificate, and then at selecting the underlying cause of death. The latter is the main information used for statistical analyses. Three main types of analysis emerge in the literature: the exploitation of data on the death certificate only, ecological analyses (studies of associations between variables measured across groups) and analysis from data individually linked to other databases. Many public health issues can be addressed with these various analyses. Several developments in the production process are being implemented: the deployment of electronic certification, increased automation of the death certificate information processing and durable and complete record linkage with health insurance and hospitalisation data. They could soon be deeply expanding the scope of possible uses of causes of death data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: For the UK Biobank, standardized phenotype codes are associated with patients who have been hospitalized but are missing for many patients who have been treated exclusively in an outpatient setting. We describe a method for phenotype recognition that imputes phenotype codes for all UK Biobank participants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: POPDx (Population-based Objective Phenotyping by Deep Extrapolation) is a bilinear machine learning framework for simultaneously estimating the probabilities of 1538 phenotype codes. We extracted phenotypic and health-related information of 392 246 individuals from the UK Biobank for POPDx development and evaluation. A total of 12 803 ICD-10 diagnosis codes of the patients were converted to 1538 phecodes as gold standard labels. The POPDx framework was evaluated and compared to other available methods on automated multiphenotype recognition. RESULTS: POPDx can predict phenotypes that are rare or even unobserved in training. We demonstrate substantial improvement of automated multiphenotype recognition across 22 disease categories, and its application in identifying key epidemiological features associated with each phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: POPDx helps provide well-defined cohorts for downstream studies. It is a general-purpose method that can be applied to other biobanks with diverse but incomplete data.

AB  - Electronic health records contain important data elements for detection of novel adverse drug reactions, genotype/phenotype identification and psychosocial factor analysis, and the role of each of these as risk factors for suicidality warrants further investigation. Suicide and suicidal ideation are documented in clinical narratives. The specific purpose of this study was to define an algorithm for automated detection of this serious event. We found that ICD-9 E-Codes had the lowest positive predictive value: 0.55 (90% CI: 0.42-0.67), while combining ICD-9 and NLP had the best PPV: 0.97 (90% CI: 0.92-0.99). A qualitative analysis and classification of the types of errors by ICD-9 and NLP automated coding compared to manual review are also discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for diverticulitis. However, it remains unclear whether visceral fat area, a more precise measurement of abdominal fat, is associated with the risk of diverticulitis. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of incident and recurrent diverticulitis according to visceral fat area. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS: The Mass General Brigham Biobank. PATIENTS: A total of 6654 patients who underwent abdominal CT for clinical indications and had no diagnosis of diverticulitis, IBD, or cancer before the scan were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visceral fat area, subcutaneous fat area, and skeletal muscle area were quantified using a deep-learning model applied to abdominal CT. The main exposures were z -scores of body composition metrics normalized by age, sex, and race. Diverticulitis cases were identified using the International Classification of Diseases codes for the primary or admitting diagnosis from the electronic health records. The risks of incident diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis, and recurrent diverticulitis requiring hospitalization according to quartiles of body composition metrics z -scores were estimated. RESULTS: A higher visceral fat area z -score was associated with an increased risk of incident diverticulitis (multivariable HR comparing the highest vs lowest quartile, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.48-2.95; p for trend <0.0001), complicated diverticulitis (HR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.10-5.99; p for trend = 0.02), and recurrence requiring hospitalization (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.15-6.62; p for trend = 0.03). The association between visceral fat area and diverticulitis was not materially different among different strata of BMI. Subcutaneous fat area and skeletal muscle area were not significantly associated with diverticulitis. LIMITATIONS: The study population was limited to individuals who underwent CT scans for medical indication. CONCLUSIONS: Higher visceral fat area derived from CT was associated with incident and recurrent diverticulitis. Our findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiology of diverticulitis and may have implications for preventive strategies. See Video Abstract . GRASA VISCERAL CUANTIFICADA MEDIANTE UN ALGORITMO DE APRENDIZAJE PROFUNDO TOTALMENTE AUTOMATIZADO Y RIESGO DE DIVERTICULITIS RECURRENTE E INCIDENTAL: ANTECEDENTES:La obesidad es un factor de riesgo de la diverticulitis. Sin embargo, sigue sin estar claro si el área de grasa visceral, con medida más precisa de la grasa abdominal esté asociada con el riesgo de diverticulitis.OBJETIVO:Estimar el riesgo de diverticulitis incidente y recurrente de acuerdo con el área de grasa visceral.DISEÑO:Un estudio de cohorte retrospectivo.AJUSTE:El Biobanco Mass General Brigham.PACIENTES:6.654 pacientes sometidos a una TC abdominal por indicaciones clínicas y sin diagnóstico de diverticulitis, enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal o cáncer antes de la exploración.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADOS:Se cuantificaron, área de grasa visceral, área de grasa subcutánea y área de músculo esquelético, utilizando un modelo de aprendizaje profundo aplicado a la TC abdominal. Las principales exposiciones fueron puntuaciones z de métricas de composición corporal, normalizadas por edad, sexo y raza. Los casos de diverticulitis se definieron con los códigos ICD para el diagnóstico primario o de admisión de los registros de salud electrónicos. Se estimaron los riesgos de diverticulitis incidente, diverticulitis complicada y diverticulitis recurrente que requiriera hospitalización según los cuartiles de las puntuaciones z de las métricas de composición corporal.RESULTADOS:Una puntuación z más alta del área de grasa visceral se asoció con un mayor riesgo de diverticulitis incidente (HR multivariable que compara el cuartil más alto con el más bajo, 2,09; IC del 95 %, 1,48-2,95; P para la tendencia < 0,0001), diverticulitis complicada (HR, 2,56; IC del 95 %, 1,10-5,99; P para la tendencia = 0,02) y recurrencia que requiriera hospitalización (HR, 2,76; IC del 95 %, 1,15-6,62; P para la tendencia = 0,03). La asociación entre el área de grasa visceral y la diverticulitis no fue materialmente diferente entre los diferentes estratos del índice de masa corporal. El área de grasa subcutánea y el área del músculo esquelético no se asociaron significativamente con la diverticulitis.LIMITACIONES:La población del estudio se limitó a individuos sometidos a tomografías computarizadas por indicación médica.CONCLUSIÓN:Una mayor área de grasa visceral derivada de la tomografía computarizada se asoció con diverticulitis incidente y recurrente. Nuestros hallazgos brindan información sobre la fisiopatología subyacente de la diverticulitis y pueden tener implicaciones para las estrategias preventivas. (Traducción: Dr. Fidel Ruiz Healy ).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The US opioid overdose epidemic continues to escalate. The restrictions on methadone availability including take-home dosing were loosened during the COVID-19 pandemic although there have been concerns about the high street value of diverted methadone. This report examined how fatal overdoses involving methadone have changed over the past two-decades including during the pandemic. METHODS: The CDC's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) was used to find the unintentional methadone related overdose death rate from 1999 to 2020. Unintentional methadone deaths were defined using the ICD X40-44 codes with only data for methadone (T40.3). Data from the DEA's Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) on methadone overall use, opioid treatment programs use, and pain management use was gathered for all states for 2020 and corrected for population. RESULTS: There have been dynamic changes over the past two-decades in methadone overdoses. Overdoses increased from 1999 (0.9/million) to 2007 (15.9) and declined until 2019 (6.5). Overdoses in 2020 (9.6) were 48.1% higher than in 2019 (t(50) = 3.05, p < .005). The state level correlations between overall methadone use (r(49) = +0.75, p < .001), and opioid treatment program use (r(49) = +0.77, p < .001) with overdoses were positive, strong, and statistically significant. However, methadone use for pain treatment was not associated with methadone overdoses (r(49) = -0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Overdoses involving methadone significantly increased by 48.1% in 2020 relative to 2019. Policy changes that were implemented following the COVID-19 pandemic involving methadone take-homes may warrant further study before they are made permanent.

AB  - Healthcare integrated biobanking describes the annotation and collection of residual samples from hospitalized patients for research purposes. The central idea of the current work is to establish an automated workflow for sample annotation, selection and storage for diabetes mellitus. This is challenging due to incomplete data at the time of sample selection. The study evaluates a machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) based two-step procedure for timely and precise sample annotation for diabetes mellitus. Electronic health record data of 785 persons were extracted from the hospital information system. In the first step, a conditional inference forest (CIF) model was trained and tested based on laboratory values from the first 72 h of the hospital stay using test- (n = 550) and training data sets (n = 235). Performance was compared with a simple laboratory cut-off classifier (LCC) and a logistic regression (LR) model. Algorithms based on laboratory values, ICD-10 codes or information from discharge summaries extracted by a natural language processing software (NLP-DS) were evaluated as a second (review) step designed to increase the precision of annotations. For the first step, recall/precision/F1-score/accuracy were 71 %/86 %/0.78/0.82 for CIF and 77 %/70 %/0.74/0.75 for LR compared to 73 %/68 %/0.70/0.72 for LCC. NLP-DS was the best-performing second (review) step (93 %/100 %/0.97/0.97). Combining first-step models with NLP-DS increased precision to 100 % for all procedures (66 %/100 %/0.80/0.85 for CIF&NLP-DS, 72 %/100 %/0.84/87.2 for LR&NLP-DS and 66 %/100 %/0.80/0.85 for LCC&NLP-DS). The number of samples removed by NLP-DS was higher for LR&NLP-DS and LCC&NLP-DS (removal rate 35 % and 38 % of initially selected samples) compared to CIF&NLP-DS (removal rate of 20 %). The developed two-step procedure is an efficient implementable method for timely and precise annotation of samples from diabetic hospitalized patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abstracting cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) from inpatient electronic medical records (EMRs) through natural language processing (NLP) is pivotal for automated disease surveillance and improving patient outcomes. Existing methods rely on coders' abstraction, which has time delays and under-coding issues. This study sought to develop an NLP-based method to detect CeVD using EMR clinical notes. METHODS: CeVD status was confirmed through a chart review on randomly selected hospitalized patients who were 18 years or older and discharged from 3 hospitals in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, between January 1 and June 30, 2015. These patients' chart data were linked to administrative discharge abstract database (DAD) and Sunrise RESULT: Of the study sample (n = 3036), the prevalence of CeVD was 11.8% (n = 360); the median patient age was 63; and females accounted for 50.3% (n = 1528) based on chart data. Among 49 extracted clinical documents from the EMR, four document types were identified as the most influential text sources for identifying CeVD disease ("nursing transfer report," "discharge summary," "nursing notes," and "inpatient consultation."). The best performing NLP model was XGBoost, combining the Unified Medical Language System concepts extracted by cTAKES (e.g., top-ranked concepts, "Cerebrovascular accident" and "Transient ischemic attack"), and the term frequency-inverse document frequency vectorizer. Compared with ICD codes, the model achieved higher validity overall, such as sensitivity (25.0% vs 70.0%), specificity (99.3% vs 99.1%), PPV (82.6 vs. 87.8%), and NPV (90.8% vs 97.1%). CONCLUSION: The NLP algorithm developed in this study performed better than the ICD code algorithm in detecting CeVD. The NLP models could result in an automated EMR tool for identifying CeVD cases and be applied for future studies such as surveillance, and longitudinal studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of robotic lobectomy (Robot-L) have been performed using data from high-volume, specialty centers which may not be generalizable. The purpose of this study was to compare mortality, length of stay (LOS), and cost between Robot-L and thoracoscopic lobectomy (VATS-L) using a nationally representative database hypothesizing they would be similar. METHODS: The Premier Healthcare Database was used to identify patients receiving elective lobectomy for lung cancer from 2009 to 2019. Patients were categorized as receiving Robot-L or VATS-L using ICD-9/10 codes. Survey methodology and patient level weighting were used to correct for sampling error and estimation of a nationally representative sample. A propensity match analysis was performed to reduce bias between the groups. Primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were LOS and patient charges. RESULTS: Among 62 698 patients, 19 506 (31.1%) underwent Robot-L and 43 192 (68.9%) underwent VATS-L. Differences between the groups included age, race, comorbidities, and insurance type. A propensity matched cohort demonstrated similar in-hospital mortality for Robot-L and VATS-L (.9% vs .9%, respectively,  CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative database, Robot-L and VATS-L had similar mortality. Although Robot-L was associated with shorter hospitalization, it was also associated with excess charges of almost $20,000. As Robot-L is now the most common approach for lobectomy in the U.S., further study into the cost and benefit of robotic surgery is warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to compare data collected by automated form processing with manual data collection for clinical indicators (CIs) in paediatric emergency medicine. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Paediatric patients presenting with croup, asthma, bronchiolitis, head injury and gastroenteritis in August 2006 were identified by ICD 9 coding and a traditional manual audit was performed by two data collectors. Data were collected on a total of 16 CIs for these five illnesses. Manual audit data were then compared to information collected for this same patient population using TELEform, an automated forms processing (AFP) system that had been employed for over two years. FINDINGS: Teleform data were only available for 24 patients compared to information for 127 patients identified by ICD 9 coding and manual audit. Teleform data overestimated compliance with clinical guidelines by 17 percent giving an overall departmental agreement with CIs of 90.6 percent compared to 73.5 percent in the manual audit. Additionally, manual audit demonstrated that when the clinical guideline was incorporated into the clinical record, compliance was 92.5 percent compared to 51.3 percent when it was not. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This single center study demonstrates that data collected by AFP such as TELEform, overestimate emergency department performance regarding CIs compliance. Departments that use automated data collection tools need to establish relationships between such data and data collected via more traditional auditing methods.

AB  - Large biomedical datasets can contain thousands of variables, creating challenges for machine learning tasks such as causal inference and prediction. Feature selection and ranking methods have been developed to reduce the number of variables and determine which are most important. However in many cases, such as in classification from diagnosis codes, ontologies, and controlled vocabularies, we must choose not only which variables to include but also at what level of granularity. ICD-9 codes, for example, are arranged in a hierarchy, and a user must decide at what level codes should be analyzed. Thus it is currently up to a researcher to decide whether to use any diagnosis of diabetes or whether to distinguish between specific forms, such as Type 2 diabetes with renal complications versus without mention of complications. Currently, there is no existing method that can automatically make this determination and methods for feature selection do not exploit this hierarchical information, which is found in other areas including nutrition (hierarchies of foods), and bioinformatics (hierarchical relationship of genes). To address this, we propose a novel Hierarchical Information Criterion (HIC) that builds on mutual information and allows fully automated abstraction of variables. Using HIC allows us to rank hierarchical features and select the ones with the highest score. We show that this significantly improves performance by an average AUROC of 0.053 over traditional feature selection methods and hand crafted features on two mortality prediction tasks using MIMIC-III ICU data. Our method also improves on the state of the art (Fu et al., 2019) with an AUROC increase from 0.819 to 0.887.

AB  - The prompt identification of frailty in primary care is the first step to offer personalized care to older individuals. We aimed to detect and quantify frailty among primary care older patients, by developing and validating a primary care frailty index (PC-FI) based on routinely collected health records and providing sex-specific frailty charts. The PC-FI was developed using data from 308,280 primary care patients ≥ 60 years old part of the Health Search Database (HSD) in Italy (baseline 2013-2019) and validated in the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K; baseline 2001-2004), a well-characterized population-based cohort including 3363 individuals ≥ 60 years old. Potential health deficits part of the PC-FI were identified through ICD-9, ATC, and exemption codes and selected through an optimization algorithm (i.e., genetic algorithm), using all-cause mortality as the main outcome for the PC-FI development. The PC-FI association at 1, 3 and 5 years, and discriminative ability for mortality and hospitalization were tested in Cox models. The convergent validity with frailty-related measures was verified in SNAC-K. The following cut-offs were used to define absent, mild, moderate and severe frailty: < 0.07, 0.07-0.14, 0.14-0.21, and ≥ 0.21. Mean age of HSD and SNAC-K participants was 71.0 years (55.4% females). The PC-FI included 25 health deficits and showed an independent association with mortality (hazard ratio range 2.03-2.27; p < 0.05) and hospitalization (hazard ratio range 1.25-1.64; p < 0.05) and a fair-to-good discriminative ability (c-statistics range 0.74-0.84 for mortality and 0.59-0.69 for hospitalization). In HSD 34.2%, 10.9% and 3.8% were deemed mildly, moderately, and severely frail, respectively. In the SNAC-K cohort, the associations between PC-FI and mortality and hospitalization were stronger than in the HSD and PC-FI scores were associated with physical frailty (odds ratio 4.25 for each 0.1 increase; p < 0.05; area under the curve 0.84), poor physical performance, disability, injurious falls, and dementia. Almost 15% of primary care patients ≥ 60 years old are affected by moderate or severe frailty in Italy. We propose a reliable, automated, and easily implementable frailty index that can be used to screen the primary care population for frailty.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death globally. Clinical practice guidelines aimed at improving disease management and positively impacting major cardiac adverse events recommend genetic testing for inherited cardiovascular conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), long QT syndrome (LQTS), hereditary amyloidosis, and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH); however, little is known about how consistently practitioners order genetic testing for these conditions in routine clinical practice. This study aimed to assess the adoption of guideline-directed genetic testing for patients diagnosed with DCM, HCM, LQTS, hereditary amyloidosis, or FH. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study captured real-world evidence of genetic testing from ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes, procedure codes, and structured text fields of de-identified patient records in the Veradigm Health Insights Ambulatory EHR Research Database linked with insurance claims data. Data analysis was conducted using an automated electronic health record analysis engine. Patient records in the Veradigm database were sourced from more than 250,000 clinicians serving over 170 million patients in outpatient primary care and specialty practice settings in the United States and linked insurance claims data from public and private insurance providers. The primary outcome measure was evidence of genetic testing within six months of condition diagnosis. RESULTS: Between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2021, 224,641 patients were newly diagnosed with DCM, HCM, LQTS, hereditary amyloidosis, or FH and included in this study. Substantial genetic testing care gaps were identified. Only a small percentage of patients newly diagnosed with DCM (827/101,919; 0.8%), HCM (253/15,507; 1.6%), LQTS (650/56,539; 1.2%), hereditary amyloidosis (62/1,026; 6.0%), or FH (718/49,650; 1.5%) received genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing is underutilized across multiple inherited cardiovascular conditions. This real-world data analysis provides insights into the delivery of genomic healthcare in the United States and suggests genetic testing guidelines are rarely followed in practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common cause of hospital admissions. Medical records contain valuable information about CHF, but manual chart review is time-consuming. Claims databases (using International Classification of Diseases [ICD] codes) provide a scalable alternative but are less accurate. Automated analysis of medical records through natural language processing (NLP) enables more efficient adjudication but has not yet been validated across multiple sites. OBJECTIVE: We seek to accurately classify the diagnosis of CHF based on structured and unstructured data from each patient, including medications, ICD codes, and information extracted through NLP of notes left by providers, by comparing the effectiveness of several machine learning models. METHODS: We developed an NLP model to identify CHF from medical records using electronic health records (EHRs) from two hospitals (Mass General Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; from 2010 to 2023), with 2800 clinical visit notes from 1821 patients. We trained and compared the performance of logistic regression, random forests, and RoBERTa models. We measured model performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). These models were also externally validated by training the data on one hospital sample and testing on the other, and an overall estimated error was calculated using a completely random sample from both hospitals. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 66.7 (SD 17.2) years; 978 (54.3%) out of 1821 patients were female. The logistic regression model achieved the best performance using a combination of ICD codes, medications, and notes, with an AUROC of 0.968 (95% CI 0.940-0.982) and an AUPRC of 0.921 (95% CI 0.835-0.969). The models that only used ICD codes or medications had lower performance. The estimated overall error rate in a random EHR sample was 1.6%. The model also showed high external validity from training on Mass General Hospital data and testing on Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center data (AUROC 0.927, 95% CI 0.908-0.944) and vice versa (AUROC 0.968, 95% CI 0.957-0.976). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed EHR-based phenotyping model for CHF achieved excellent performance, external validity, and generalization across two institutions. The model enables multiple downstream uses, paving the way for large-scale studies of CHF treatment effectiveness, comorbidities, outcomes, and mechanisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study introduces a novel tokenisation methodology, K-Tokeniser, to infuse clinical knowledge into language models for clinical text processing. METHODS: Technically, at initialisation stage, K-Tokeniser populates global representations of tokens based on semantic types of domain concepts (such as drugs or diseases) from either a domain ontology like Unified Medical Language System or the training data of the task related corpus. At training or inference stage, sentence level localised context will be utilised for choosing the optimal global token representation to realise the semantic-based tokenisation. To avoid pretraining using the new tokeniser, an embedding initialisation approach is proposed to generate representations for new tokens. RESULTS: Using three transformer-based language models, a comprehensive set of experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets for evaluating K-Tokeniser in a wide range of clinical text analytics tasks including clinical concept and relation extraction, automated clinical coding, clinical phenotype identification, and clinical research article classification. Overall, our models demonstrate consistent improvements over their counterparts in all tasks. In particular, substantial improvements are observed in the automated clinical coding task with 13% increase on Micro F CONCLUSION: Models built using K-Tokeniser have shown faster convergence. Specifically,the language models would only require 50% of the training data to achieve the best performance of the baseline tokeniser using all training data in the concept extraction task and less than 20% of the data for the automated coding task. It is worth mentioning that all these improvements require no pre-training process, making the approach generalisable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Incidental durotomy is a common intraoperative complication during spine surgery with potential implications for postoperative recovery, patient-reported outcomes, length of stay, and costs. To our knowledge, there are no processes available for automated surveillance of incidental durotomy. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to develop natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for automated detection of incidental durotomies in free-text operative notes of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. PATIENT SAMPLE: Adult patients 18 years or older undergoing lumbar spine surgery between January 1, 2000 and June 31, 2018 at two academic and three community medical centers. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was defined as intraoperative durotomy recorded in free-text operative notes. METHODS: An 80:20 stratified split was undertaken to create training and testing populations. An extreme gradient-boosting NLP algorithm was developed to detect incidental durotomy. Discrimination was assessed via area under receiver-operating curve (AUC-ROC), precision-recall curve, and Brier score. Performance of this algorithm was compared with current procedural terminology (CPT) and international classification of diseases (ICD) codes for durotomy. RESULTS: Overall, 1,000 patients were included in the study and 93 (9.3%) had a recorded incidental durotomy in the free-text operative report. In the independent testing set (n=200) not used for model development, the NLP algorithm achieved AUC-ROC of 0.99 for detection of durotomy. In comparison, the CPT/ICD codes had AUC-ROC of 0.64. In the testing set, the NLP algorithm detected 16 of 18 patients with incidental durotomy (sensitivity 0.89) whereas the CPT and ICD codes detected 5 of 18 (sensitivity 0.28). At a threshold of 0.05, the NLP algorithm had specificity of 0.99, positive predictive value of 0.89, and negative predictive value of 0.99. CONCLUSIONS: Internal validation of the NLP algorithm developed in this study indicates promising results for future NLP applications in spine surgery. Pending external validation, the NLP algorithm developed in this study may be used by entities including national spine registries or hospital quality and safety departments to automate tracking of incidental durotomies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is underdiagnosed in health system settings, limiting research on OUD using electronic health records (EHRs). Medical encounter notes can enrich structured EHR data with documented signs and symptoms of OUD and social risks and behaviors. To capture this information at scale, natural language processing (NLP) tools must be developed and evaluated. We developed and applied an annotation schema to deeply characterize OUD and related clinical, behavioral, and environmental factors, and automated the annotation schema using machine learning and deep learning-based approaches. METHODS: Using the MIMIC-III Critical Care Database, we queried hospital discharge summaries of patients with  RESULTS: The resulting annotation schema contained 32 classes. We achieved moderate inter-annotator agreement, with F CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated that rich information regarding problematic opioid use can be manually identified by annotators. However, more training samples and features would improve our ability to reliably identify less common classes from clinical text, including text from outpatient settings.

AB  - The adoption of robotic assistance in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) is growing rapidly worldwide. This study aims to evaluate recent trends in the utilization of robotic-assisted TKA and THA across the United States spanning a 12-year period. This retrospective analysis utilized the PearlDiver All Payer Claims Database to identify patients who underwent primary, elective primary TKA or THA between 2010 and 2022. Procedures were categorized as conventional or robot assisted based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9), ICD-10, and Current Procedural Technology (CPT) codes. Patient demographics were captured including age, sex, and comorbidities. Annual usage trends for each modality were analyzed. Simple linear regressions were utilized to evaluate changes in the proportion of annual robot-assisted TJA performed over time relative to total procedures. P values < 0.05 were significant. Of the 2,294,076 total TKAs performed between 2010 and 2022, 1.58% were robotic assisted. Similarly, of the 1,235,577 total THAs performed, 1.26% utilized robotic assistance. Robotic TKA accounted for a steadily increasing percentage of total TKA procedures, significantly growing from 0.35% in 2010 to 3.45% in 2022, peaking at 4.39% in 2019 (P < 0.001). Similarly, robotic THA utilization showed significant growth, increasing from 0.26% in 2010 to 2.36% in 2022, peaking at 3.59% in 2019 (P < 0.001). The use of robotic-assisted TKA and THA has seen significant growth across the United States. Robotic TKA and THA have become increasingly utilized technologies, with steady growth in adoption since 2010.Level of evidence: III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To gain maximum insight from large administrative healthcare datasets it is important to understand their data quality. Although a gold standard against which to assess criterion validity rarely exists for such datasets, internal consistency can be evaluated. We aimed to identify inconsistencies in the recording of mandatory International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth revision (ICD-10) codes within the Hospital Episodes Statistics dataset in England. METHODS: Three exemplar medical conditions where recording is mandatory once diagnosed were chosen: autism, type II diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's disease dementia. We identified the first occurrence of the condition ICD-10 code for a patient during the period April 2013 to March 2021 and in subsequent hospital spells. We designed and trained random forest classifiers to identify variables strongly associated with recording inconsistencies. RESULTS: For autism, diabetes and Parkinson's disease dementia respectively, 43.7%, 8.6% and 31.2% of subsequent spells had inconsistencies. Coding inconsistencies were highly correlated with non-coding of an underlying condition, a change in hospital trust and greater time between the spell with the first coded diagnosis and the subsequent spell. For patients with diabetes or Parkinson's disease dementia, the code recording for spells without an overnight stay were found to have a higher rate of inconsistencies. CONCLUSIONS: Data inconsistencies are relatively common for the three conditions considered. Where these mandatory diagnoses are not recorded in administrative datasets, and where clinical decisions are made based on such data, there is potential for this to impact patient care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnostic errors and administrative burdens, including medical coding, remain major challenges in health care. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to alleviate these problems, but their adoption has been limited by concerns regarding reliability, transparency, and clinical safety. OBJECTIVE: This study introduces and evaluates 2 LLM-based frameworks, implemented within the Rhazes Clinician platform, designed to address these challenges: generation-assisted retrieval-augmented generation (GARAG) for automated evidence-based treatment planning and generation-assisted vector search (GAVS) for automated medical coding. METHODS: GARAG was evaluated on 21 clinical test cases created by medically qualified authors. Each case was executed 3 times independently, and outputs were assessed using 4 criteria: correctness of references, absence of duplication, adherence to formatting, and clinical appropriateness of the generated management plan. GAVS was evaluated on 958 randomly selected admissions from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, in which billed International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes served as the ground truth. Two approaches were compared: a direct GPT-4.1 baseline prompted to predict ICD-10 codes without constraints and GAVS, in which GPT-4.1 generated diagnostic entities that were each mapped onto the top 10 matching ICD-10 codes through vector search. RESULTS: Across the 63 outputs, 62 (98.4%) satisfied all evaluation criteria, with the only exception being a minor ordering inconsistency in one repetition of case 14. For GAVS, the 958 admissions contained 8576 assigned ICD-10 subcategory codes (1610 unique). The vanilla LLM produced 131,329 candidate codes, whereas GAVS produced 136,920. At the subcategory level, the vanilla LLM achieved 17.95% average recall (15.86% weighted), while GAVS achieved 20.63% (18.62% weighted), a statistically significant improvement (P<.001). At the category level, performance converged (32.60% vs 32.58% average weighted recall; P=.99). CONCLUSIONS: GARAG demonstrated a workflow that grounds management plans in diagnosis-specific, peer-reviewed guideline evidence, preserving fine-grained clinical detail during retrieval. GAVS significantly improved fine-grained diagnostic coding recall compared with a direct LLM baseline. Together, these frameworks illustrate how LLM-based methods can enhance clinical decision support and medical coding. Both were subsequently integrated into Rhazes Clinician, a clinician-facing web application that orchestrates LLM agents to call specialized tools, providing a single interface for physician use. Further independent validation and large-scale studies are required to confirm generalizability and assess their impact on patient outcomes.

AB  - AIMS: Electronic health records (EHR) linked to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), biological specimens, and deep learning (DL) algorithms could potentially improve patient care through automated case detection and surveillance. We hypothesized that by applying keyword searches to routinely stored EHR, in conjunction with AI-powered automated reading of DICOM echocardiography images and analysing biomarkers from routinely stored plasma samples, we were able to identify heart failure (HF) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used EHR data between 1993 and 2021 from Tayside and Fife (~20% of the Scottish population). We implemented a keyword search strategy complemented by filtering based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and prescription data to EHR data set. We then applied DL for the automated interpretation of echocardiographic DICOM images. These methods were then integrated with the analysis of routinely stored plasma samples to identify and categorize patients into HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and controls without HF. The final diagnosis was verified through a manual review of medical records, measured natriuretic peptides in stored blood samples, and by comparing clinical outcomes among groups. In our study, we selected the patient cohort through an algorithmic workflow. This process started with 60 850 EHR data and resulted in a final cohort of 578 patients, divided into 186 controls, 236 with HFpEF, and 156 with HFrEF, after excluding individuals with mismatched data or significant valvular heart disease. The analysis of baseline characteristics revealed that compared with controls, patients with HFrEF and HFpEF were generally older, had higher BMI, and showed a greater prevalence of co-morbidities such as diabetes, COPD, and CKD. Echocardiographic analysis, enhanced by DL, provided high coverage, and detailed insights into cardiac function, showing significant differences in parameters such as left ventricular diameter, ejection fraction, and myocardial strain among the groups. Clinical outcomes highlighted a higher risk of hospitalization and mortality for HF patients compared with controls, with particularly elevated risk ratios for both HFrEF and HFpEF groups. The concordance between the algorithmic selection of patients and manual validation demonstrated high accuracy, supporting the effectiveness of our approach in identifying and classifying HF subtypes, which could significantly impact future HF diagnosis and management strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the feasibility of combining keyword searches in EHR, DL automated echocardiographic interpretation, and biobank resources to identify HF subtypes.

AB  - The Australian mortality data are a foundational health dataset which supports research, policy and planning. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the need for more timely mortality data that could assist in monitoring direct mortality from the virus as well as indirect mortality due to social and economic societal change. This paper discusses the evolution of mortality data in Australia during the pandemic and looks at emerging opportunities associated with electronic infrastructure such as electronic Medical Certificates of Cause of Death (eMCCDs), ICD-11 and automated coding tools that will form the foundations of a more responsive and comprehensive future mortality dataset.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As opioid prescriptions have risen, there has also been an increase in opioid use disorder (OUD) and its adverse outcomes. Accurate and complete epidemiologic surveillance of OUD, to inform prevention strategies, presents challenges. The objective of this study was to ascertain prevalence of OUD using two methods to identify OUD in electronic health records (EHR): applying natural language processing (NLP) for text mining of unstructured clinical notes and using ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes. METHODS: Data were drawn from EHR records for hospital and emergency department patient visits to a large regional academic medical center from 2017 to 2019. International Classification of Disease, 10th Edition, Clinic Modification (ICD-10-CM) discharge codes were extracted for each visit. To develop the rule-based NLP algorithm, a stepwise process was used. First, a small sample of visits from 2017 was used to develop initial dictionaries. Next, EHR corresponding to 30,124 visits from 2018 were used to develop and evaluate the rule-based algorithm. A random sample of the results were manually reviewed to identify and address shortcomings in the algorithm, and to estimate sensitivity and specificity of the two methods of ascertainment. Last, the final algorithm was then applied to 29,212 visits from 2019 to estimate OUD prevalence. RESULTS: While there was substantial overlap in the identified records (n = 1,381 [59.2 %]), overall n = 2,332 unique visits were identified. Of the total unique visits, 430 (18.4 %) were identified only by ICD-10-CM codes, and 521 (22.3 %) were identified only by NLP. The prevalence of visits with evidence of an OUD diagnosis in this sample, ascertained using only ICD-10-CM codes, was 1,811/29,212 (6.1 %). Including the additional 521 visits identified only by NLP, the estimated prevalence of OUD is 2,332/29,212 (7.9 %), an increase of 29.5 % compared to the use of ICD-10-CM codes alone. The estimated sensitivity and specificity of the NLP-based OUD classification were 81.8 % and 97.5 %, respectively, relative to gold-standard manual review by an expert addiction medicine physician. CONCLUSION: NLP-based algorithms can automate data extraction and identify evidence of opioid use disorder from unstructured electronic healthcare records. The most complete ascertainment of OUD in EHR was combined NLP with ICD-10-CM codes. NLP should be considered for epidemiological studies involving EHR data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous work in the field of medical informatics has shown that rules-based algorithms can be created to identify patients with various medical conditions; however, these techniques have not been compared to actual clinician notes nor has the ability to predict complications been tested. We hypothesize that a rules-based algorithm can successfully identify patients with the diseases in the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI). METHODS: Patients undergoing surgery at the University of California, Los Angeles Health System between April 1, 2013 and July 1, 2016 and who had at least 2 previous office visits were included. For each disease in the RCRI except renal failure-congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus-diagnosis algorithms were created based on diagnostic and standard clinical treatment criteria. For each disease state, the prevalence of the disease as determined by the algorithm, International Classification of Disease (ICD) code, and anesthesiologist's preoperative note were determined. Additionally, 400 American Society of Anesthesiologists classes III and IV cases were randomly chosen for manual review by an anesthesiologist. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were determined using the manual review as a gold standard. Last, the ability of the RCRI as calculated by each of the methods to predict in-hospital mortality was determined, and the time necessary to run the algorithms was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 64,151 patients met inclusion criteria for the study. In general, the incidence of definite or likely disease determined by the algorithms was higher than that detected by the anesthesiologist. Additionally, in all disease states, the prevalence of disease was always lowest for the ICD codes, followed by the preoperative note, followed by the algorithms. In the subset of patients for whom the records were manually reviewed, the algorithms were generally the most sensitive and the ICD codes the most specific. When computing the modified RCRI using each of the methods, the modified RCRI from the algorithms predicted in-hospital mortality with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.70 (0.67-0.73), which compared to 0.70 (0.67-0.72) for ICD codes and 0.64 (0.61-0.67) for the preoperative note. On average, the algorithms took 12.64 ± 1.20 minutes to run on 1.4 million patients. CONCLUSIONS: Rules-based algorithms for disease in the RCRI can be created that perform with a similar discriminative ability as compared to physician notes and ICD codes but with significantly increased economies of scale.

AB  - Background Generating radiologic findings from chest radiographs is pivotal in medical image analysis. The emergence of OpenAI's generative pretrained transformer, GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V), has opened new perspectives on the potential for automated image-text pair generation. However, the application of GPT-4V to real-world chest radiography is yet to be thoroughly examined. Purpose To investigate the capability of GPT-4V to generate radiologic findings from real-world chest radiographs. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 100 chest radiographs with free-text radiology reports were annotated by a cohort of radiologists, two attending physicians and three residents, to establish a reference standard. Of 100 chest radiographs, 50 were randomly selected from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) chest radiographic data set, and 50 were randomly selected from the Medical Imaging and Data Resource Center (MIDRC). The performance of GPT-4V at detecting imaging findings from each chest radiograph was assessed in the zero-shot setting (where it operates without prior examples) and few-shot setting (where it operates with two examples). Its outcomes were compared with the reference standard with regards to clinical conditions and their corresponding codes in the

AB  - The mapping from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) to the 11th Revision (ICD-11), initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO), presents a challenge for healthcare systems, most of which currently rely on extensive ICD-10 coded data for billing purposes. This paper introduces a methodology to generate a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) ConceptMap from the WHO-provided ICD-10 to ICD-11 mapping tables. The resulting ConceptMap allows healthcare organizations to automate the mapping process, facilitating the integration of ICD-11. The final ConceptMap includes ICD-11 mappings for 12,952 ICD-10 codes. This approach prepares healthcare systems for the transition to ICD-11.

AB  - Assigning ICD-10 code of sepsis in regard of a pathogenic bacterium found in an haemoculture requires knowledge of microbiology because of the difference of granularity. The aim of this paper is to automate this coding thanks to the use of SNOMED-CT. A dichotomous classification of bacteria causing sepsis has been generated in respect of ICD-10. Our algorithm follows this and explores SNOMED-CT to assign the right ICD-10 code of the sepsis. Applied to a list of 164 bacteria, the system has an error rate of 1.22 %.

AB  - Post-licensure vaccine safety studies often monitor for seizures using automated screening of ICD-9 codes. This study assessed the positive predictive value (PPV) of ICD-9 codes used to identify seizure visits in children aged 6 weeks to 23 months who were enrolled in seven managed care organizations during January 2000 to December 2005. ICD-9 codes were used to identify visits for seizures in the 0-30-day period following receipt of a pneumococcal vaccine. Visits were stratified by setting of diagnosis (emergency department (ED), outpatient, and inpatient). Review of medical records confirmed whether the visit represented a true acute seizure event. 3233 visits for seizures were identified; 1024 were randomly selected for medical record review and 859 (84%) had records available. The PPV of ICD-9 codes was highest in the ED setting (97%), followed by the inpatient setting (64%). In the outpatient setting, computerized codes for seizures had very low PPV: 16% on days 1-30 following vaccination and 2% for visits on the same day of vaccination. An estimated 77% of true seizures identified were from the ED or inpatient settings. In conclusion, when using ICD-9 codes to identify seizure outcomes, restricting to the ED and inpatient settings of diagnosis may result in less biased preliminary analyses and more efficient vaccine safety studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurately assigning ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) codes is critical for clinical documentation, reimbursement processes, epidemiological studies, and health care planning. Manual coding is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors, underscoring the need for automated solutions within the Norwegian health care system. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and transformer-based language models have shown promising results in automating ICD (International Classification of Diseases) coding in several languages. However, prior work has focused primarily on English and other high-resource languages, leaving a gap in Norwegian-specific clinical NLP research. OBJECTIVE: This study introduces 2 versions of NorDeClin-BERT (NorDeClin Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), domain-specific Norwegian BERT-based models pretrained on a large corpus of Norwegian clinical text to enhance their understanding of medical language. Both models were subsequently fine-tuned to predict ICD-10 diagnosis codes. We aimed to evaluate the impact of domain-specific pretraining and model size on classification performance and to compare NorDeClin-BERT with general-purpose and cross-lingual BERT models in the context of Norwegian ICD-10 coding. METHODS: Two versions of NorDeClin-BERT were pretrained on the ClinCode Gastro Corpus, a large-scale dataset comprising 8.8 million deidentified Norwegian clinical notes, to enhance domain-specific language modeling. The base model builds upon NorBERT3-base and was pretrained on a large, relevant subset of the corpus, while the large model builds upon NorBERT3-large and was trained on the full dataset. Both models were benchmarked against SweDeClin-BERT, ScandiBERT, NorBERT3-base, and NorBERT3-large, using standard evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. RESULTS: The results show that both versions of NorDeClin-BERT outperformed general-purpose Norwegian BERT models and Swedish clinical BERT models in classifying both prevalent and less common ICD-10 codes. Notably, NorDeClin-BERT-large achieved the highest overall performance across evaluation metrics, demonstrating the impact of domain-specific clinical pretraining in Norwegian. These results highlight that domain-specific pretraining on Norwegian clinical text, combined with model capacity, improves ICD-10 classification accuracy compared with general-domain Norwegian models and Swedish models pretrained on clinical text. Furthermore, while Swedish clinical models demonstrated some transferability to Norwegian, their performance remained suboptimal, emphasizing the necessity of Norwegian-specific clinical pretraining. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of NorDeClin-BERT to improve ICD-10 code classification for the gastroenterology domain in Norway, ultimately streamlining clinical documentation, reporting processes, reducing administrative burden, and enhancing coding accuracy in Norwegian health care institutions. The benchmarking evaluation establishes NorDeClin-BERT as a state-of-the-art model for processing Norwegian clinical text and predicting ICD-10 coding, establishing a new baseline for future research in Norwegian medical NLP. Future work may explore further domain adaptation techniques, external knowledge integration, and cross-hospital generalizability to enhance ICD coding performance across broader clinical settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in Australia is disparate, resource intensive, unsustainable, and provides limited information. Traditional HAI surveillance is time intensive and agreement levels between clinicians have been shown to be variable. AIM: To compare two methods: a semi-automated algorithm, and coding data, against traditional surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance methods. METHODS: This retrospective multi-centre cohort study included all patients undergoing a hip (HPRO) or knee (KPRO) prosthesis and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery during a two-year period at two large metropolitan hospitals. Routine SSI data were obtained via the infection prevention and control (IPC) team, a previously developed algorithm was applied to all patient records, and the ICD-10-AM data were searched for those categorized as having an SSI. FINDINGS: Overall, 1447, 1416, and 1026 patients who underwent HPRO, KPRO, and CABG, respectively, were included. The highest sensitivity values were generated by the algorithm: HPRO deep or organ-space (D/O) 0.87 (95% confidence interval: 0.66-0.96), CABG 0.86 (0.64-0.96), and HPRO all SSI 0.77 (0.57-89); the lowest sensitivity was Code CABG D/O 0.03 (0.00-0.21). The highest PPV values were generated by the algorithm: HPRO D/O 0.97 (0.77-0.99), CABG D/O 0.97 (0.76-0.99), and the Code HPRO D/O 0.9 (0.66-0.99). Both the algorithm and coding data resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of medical records required to review. CONCLUSION: The application of algorithms to enhance SSI surveillance demonstrates high accuracy in identifying patient records that require review by IPC teams to determine the presence of an SSI. Coding data alone should not be used to identify SSIs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Robotic coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) has developed in recent decades, however, prior studies showed conflicting result of robotic CABG compared to nonrobotic CABG in terms of mortality, morbidity, and cost. Herein, we sought to analyze the in-hospital outcomes and health care utilization after robotic CABG compared to nonrobotic CABG, based on data from a nationally representative sample. METHODS: Patients who underwent CABG were identified using the national inpatient sample. Endpoints were in-hospital outcomes, length of stay, and total cost. Procedure-related complications were identified via international classification of diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 coding and propensity score matching analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 1,204,125 weighted adults underwent nonrobotic CABG and 7355 underwent robotic CABG in the United States between 2012 and 2017. The comparison of 7330 pairs after propensity score matching showed that in-hospital mortality was higher for those who underwent nonrobotic CABG compared to those who underwent robotic CABG (2.1% vs. 1.1%, p = .029). Similarly, the rates of acute kidney injury, transfusion, postoperative hemorrhage, length of stay, and total cost were higher for nonrobotic CABG compared to robotic CABG (all p < .05). The proportions of routine discharges with (34.5% vs. 40.0%) or without (39.7% vs. 45.0%) home health care were higher among those who underwent robotic, whereas the proportion of transfer to skilled nursing facility/nursing home was more frequent for cases of nonrobotic CABG (22.4% vs. 13.4%). CONCLUSION: Robotic CABG was associated with lower rates of in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury, transfusion, postoperative hemorrhage, total cost, and shorter hospital stay compared to nonrobotic CABG.

AB  - We examined the positive predictive value of the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9), codes used to identify cases of complicated peptic ulcer disease from the Saskatchewan Hospital automated database. Nonspecific and site- and lesion-specific codes were used in case detection to increase the sensitivity of the initial computer search. Review of the hospital records of 1,762 potential cases resulted in 1,375 confirmed cases. The positive predictive value of site and lesion-specific codes was about 90% and was about 70% for the nonspecific codes. Almost 50% of cases, however, would have been missed if the nonspecific codes had not been used.

AB  - Standard reference terminology of diagnoses and risk factors is crucial for billing, epidemiological studies, and inter/intranational comparisons of diseases. The International Classification of Disease (ICD) is a standardized and widely used method, but the manual classification is an enormously time-consuming endeavor. Natural language processing together with machine learning allows automated structuring of diagnoses using ICD-10 codes, but the limited performance of machine learning models, the necessity of gigantic datasets, and poor reliability of terminal parts of these codes restricted clinical usability. We aimed to create a high performing pipeline for automated classification of reliable ICD-10 codes in the free medical text in cardiology. We focussed on frequently used and well-defined three- and four-digit ICD-10 codes that still have enough granularity to be clinically relevant such as atrial fibrillation (I48), acute myocardial infarction (I21), or dilated cardiomyopathy (I42.0). Our pipeline uses a deep neural network known as a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Network and was trained and tested with 5548 discharge letters and validated in 5089 discharge and procedural letters. As in clinical practice discharge letters may be labeled with more than one code, we assessed the single- and multilabel performance of main diagnoses and cardiovascular risk factors. We investigated using both the entire body of text and only the summary paragraph, supplemented by age and sex. Given the privacy-sensitive information included in discharge letters, we added a de-identification step. The performance was high, with F1 scores of 0.76-0.99 for three-character and 0.87-0.98 for four-character ICD-10 codes, and was best when using complete discharge letters. Adding variables age/sex did not affect results. For model interpretability, word coefficients were provided and qualitative assessment of classification was manually performed. Because of its high performance, this pipeline can be useful to decrease the administrative burden of classifying discharge diagnoses and may serve as a scaffold for reimbursement and research applications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate automated electronic note search strategies (automated digital algorithm) to identify Charlson comorbidities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The automated digital algorithm was built by a series of programmatic queries applied to an institutional electronic medical record database. The automated digital algorithm was derived from secondary analysis of an observational cohort study of 1447 patients admitted to the intensive care unit from January 1 through December 31, 2006, and validated in an independent cohort of 240 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the automated digital algorithm and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes were compared with comprehensive medical record review (reference standard) for the Charlson comorbidities. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, the automated digital algorithm achieved a median sensitivity of 100% (range, 99%-100%) and a median specificity of 99.7% (range, 99%-100%). In the validation cohort, the sensitivity of the automated digital algorithm ranged from 91% to 100%, and the specificity ranged from 98% to 100%. The sensitivity of the ICD-9 codes ranged from 8% for dementia to 100% for leukemia, whereas specificity ranged from 86% for congestive heart failure to 100% for leukemia, dementia, and AIDS. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that search strategies that use automated electronic search strategies to extract Charlson comorbidities from the clinical notes contained within the electronic medical record are feasible and reliable. Automated digital algorithm outperformed ICD-9 codes in all the Charlson variables except leukemia, with greater sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Pregnant People and Infants Network (SET-NET) collects data abstracted from medical records and birth defects registries on pregnant people and their infants to understand outcomes associated with prenatal exposures. We developed an automated process to categorize possible birth defects for prenatal COVID-19, hepatitis C, and syphilis surveillance. By employing keyword searches, fuzzy matching, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML), we aimed to decrease the number of cases needing manual clinician review. METHODS: SET-NET captures International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes and free text describing birth defects. For unstructured data, we used keyword searches, and then conducted fuzzy matching with a cut-off match score of ≥90%. Finally, we employed NLP and ML by testing three predictive models to categorize birth defect data. RESULTS: As of June 2023, 8326 observations containing data on possible birth defects were submitted to SET-NET. The majority (n = 6758 [81%]) were matched to an ICD-10-CM code and 1568 (19%) were unable to be matched. Through keyword searches and fuzzy matching, we categorized 1387/1568 possible birth defects. Of the remaining 181 unmatched observations, we correctly categorized 144 (80%) using a predictive model. CONCLUSIONS: Using automated approaches allowed for categorization of 99.6% of reported possible birth defects, which helps detect possible patterns requiring further investigation. Without employing these analytic approaches, manual review would have been needed for 1568 observations. These methods can be employed to quickly and accurately sift through data to inform public health responses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Machine learning models can reduce the burden on doctors by converting medical records into International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes in real time, thereby enhancing the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment. However, it faces challenges such as small datasets, diverse writing styles, unstructured records, and the need for semimanual preprocessing. Existing approaches, such as naive Bayes, Word2Vec, and convolutional neural networks, have limitations in handling missing values and understanding the context of medical texts, leading to a high error rate. We developed a fully automated pipeline based on the Key-bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) approach and large-scale medical records for continued pretraining, which effectively converts long free text into standard ICD codes. By adjusting parameter settings, such as mixed templates and soft verbalizers, the model can adapt flexibly to different requirements, enabling task-specific prompt learning. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to propose a prompt learning real-time framework based on pretrained language models that can automatically label long free-text data with ICD-10 codes for cardiovascular diseases without the need for semiautomatic preprocessing. METHODS: We integrated 4 components into our framework: a medical pretrained BERT, a keyword filtration BERT in a functional order, a fine-tuning phase, and task-specific prompt learning utilizing mixed templates and soft verbalizers. This framework was validated on a multicenter medical dataset for the automated ICD coding of 13 common cardiovascular diseases (584,969 records). Its performance was compared against robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach, extreme language network, and various BERT-based fine-tuning pipelines. Additionally, we evaluated the framework's performance under different prompt learning and fine-tuning settings. Furthermore, few-shot learning experiments were conducted to assess the feasibility and efficacy of our framework in scenarios involving small- to mid-sized datasets. RESULTS: Compared with traditional pretraining and fine-tuning pipelines, our approach achieved a higher micro-F1-score of 0.838 and a macro-area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (macro-AUC) of 0.958, which is 10% higher than other methods. Among different prompt learning setups, the combination of mixed templates and soft verbalizers yielded the best performance. Few-shot experiments showed that performance stabilized and the AUC peaked at 500 shots. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the effectiveness and superior performance of prompt learning and fine-tuning for subtasks within pretrained language models in medical practice. Our real-time ICD coding pipeline efficiently converts detailed medical free text into standardized labels, offering promising applications in clinical decision-making. It can assist doctors unfamiliar with the ICD coding system in organizing medical record information, thereby accelerating the medical process and enhancing the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Population-based cancer registries receive numerous free-text pathology reports from which cancer cases are manually coded according to international standards. Skin cancer is the most frequent cancer in Caucasian populations, and its incidence is increasing. We developed an AI-based method to identify skin cancer, locate relevant key terms in pathological reports, and suggest coding for the main clinical variables. METHODS: We explored multiple neural network architectures and found out that convolutional neural networks with customised noise-robust loss functions offer the best performance for identifying cancer types and pre-coding subsite, morphology, behaviour, grade, laterality, and first line of treatment of skin cancer cases. Previously registered cases were used as training data. We additionally applied an attention mechanism to extract and highlight reports' key diagnostic terms. These highlights facilitate human review of pre-coding results. We evaluated performance of the method by using manually coded cases in a separate test set. RESULTS: The accuracies of detecting skin cancer types were 0.98-0.99, and F1 scores 0.93-0.96. Pre-coding accuracy and weighted F1 score were: ICD-O subsite (4 digits): 0.89-0.91 and 0.89-0.91, morphology (4 digits): 0.61-0.90 and 0.63-0.89, morphology (3-digits): 0.86-0.98 and 0.89-0.98, tumour behaviour: 0.96-0.98 and 0.96-0.98, laterality: 0.99 and 0.98-0.99. Also, accuracy (0.96) and weighted F1 score (0.96) for the grade were estimated for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin, and treatments for SCC and melanoma (accuracies 0.84 and 0.87, weighted F1 scores and 0.82 and 0.87). The extracted key words matched ICD-O code descriptions with high precision. CONCLUSION: We piloted our method in the Vaud Cancer Registry, Switzerland. It was able to identify and pre-code skin cancer cases efficiently and find correct key terms in reports. Medical coders found pre-coding useful and time saving. Integration of the method in the registry document workflow and its extension to other cancer types are intended.

AB  - Pathology reports are a primary source of information for cancer registries which process high volumes of free-text reports annually. Information extraction and coding is a manual, labor-intensive process. In this study, we investigated deep learning and a convolutional neural network (CNN), for extracting ICD-O-3 topographic codes from a corpus of breast and lung cancer pathology reports. We performed two experiments, using a CNN and a more conventional term frequency vector approach, to assess the effects of class prevalence and inter-class transfer learning. The experiments were based on a set of 942 pathology reports with human expert annotations as the gold standard. CNN performance was compared against a more conventional term frequency vector space approach. We observed that the deep learning models consistently outperformed the conventional approaches in the class prevalence experiment, resulting in micro- and macro-F score increases of up to 0.132 and 0.226, respectively, when class labels were well populated. Specifically, the best performing CNN achieved a micro-F score of 0.722 over 12 ICD-O-3 topography codes. Transfer learning provided a consistent but modest performance boost for the deep learning methods but trends were contingent on the CNN method and cancer site. These encouraging results demonstrate the potential of deep learning for automated abstraction of pathology reports.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The optimal approach to auditing outpatient antimicrobial prescribing has not been established. We assessed how different types of electronic data-including prescriptions, patient-visits, and International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes-could inform automated antimicrobial audits. DESIGN Outpatient visits during 2016 were retrospectively reviewed, including chart abstraction, if an antimicrobial was prescribed (cohort 1) or if the visit was associated with an infection-related ICD-10 code (cohort 2). Findings from cohorts 1 and 2 were compared. SETTING Primary care clinics and the emergency department (ED) at the Iowa City Veterans Affairs Medical Center. RESULTS In cohort 1, we reviewed 2,353 antimicrobial prescriptions across 52 providers. ICD-10 codes had limited sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for validated cases of cystitis and pneumonia (sensitivity, 65.8%, 56.3%, respectively; PPV, 74.4%, 52.5%, respectively). The volume-adjusted antimicrobial prescribing rate was 13.6 per 100 ED visits and 7.5 per 100 primary care visits. In cohort 2, antimicrobials were not indicated in 474 of 851 visits (55.7%). The antimicrobial overtreatment rate was 48.8% for the ED and 59.7% for primary care. At the level of the individual prescriber, there was a positive correlation between a provider's volume-adjusted antimicrobial prescribing rate and the individualized rates of overtreatment in both the ED (r=0.72; P<.01) and the primary care setting (r=0.82; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS In this single-center study, ICD-10 codes had limited sensitivity and PPV for 2 infections that typically require antimicrobials. Electronically extracted data on a provider's rate of volume-adjusted antimicrobial prescribing correlated with the frequency at which unnecessary antimicrobials were prescribed, but this may have been driven by outlier prescribers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Contrary to the World Health Organization's internationally recommended medical certificate of cause of death, the South African (SA) death notification form (DNF) does not allow for the reporting of the manner of death to permit accurate coding of external causes of injury deaths. OBJECTIVES: To describe the injury cause-of-death profile from forensic pathology records collected for the National Cause-of-Death Validation (NCoDV) Project and compare it with profiles from other sources of injury mortality data. In particular, the recording of firearm use in homicides is compared between sources. METHODS: The NCoDV Project was a cross-sectional study of deaths that occurred during a fixed period in 2017 and 2018, from a nationally representative sample of 27 health subdistricts in SA. Trained fieldworkers scanned forensic records for all deaths investigated at the forensic mortuaries serving the sampled subdistricts during the study period. Forensic practitioners reviewed the records and completed a medical certificate of cause of death for each decedent. Causes of death were coded to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), using Iris automated coding software. Cause-specific mortality fractions for injury deaths were compared with Injury Mortality Survey 2017 (IMS 2017) and Statistics South Africa 2017 (Stats SA 2017) datasets. The cause profile for all firearm-related deaths was compared between the three datasets. RESULTS: A total of 5 315 records were available for analysis. Males accounted for 77.6% of cases, and most decedents were aged between 25 and 44 years. Homicide was the leading cause of death (34.7%), followed by transport injuries (32.6%) and suicide (14.7%). This injury cause profile was similar to IMS 2017 but differed markedly from the official statistics, which showed markedly lower proportions of these three causes (15.0%, 11.6% and 0.7%, respectively), and a much higher proportion of other unintentional causes. Investigation of firearm-related deaths revealed that most were homicides in NCoDV 2017/18 (88.5%) and IMS 2017 (93.1%), while in the Stats SA 2017 data, 98.7% of firearm deaths were classified as accidental. Approximately 7% of firearm-related deaths were suicides in NCoDV 2017/18 and IMS 2017, with only 0.3% in Stats SA 2017. CONCLUSION: The official cause-of-death data for injuries in SA in 2017 differed substantially from findings from the NCoDV 2017/18 study and IMS 2017. Accurate data sources would ensure that public health interventions are designed to reduce the high injury burden. Inclusion of the manner of death on the DNF, as is recommended internationally, is critically important to enable more accurate, reliable and valid reporting of the injury profile.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Information in pathology reports is critical for cancer care. Natural language processing (NLP) systems used to extract information from pathology reports are often narrow in scope or require extensive tuning. Consequently, there is growing interest in automated deep learning approaches. A powerful new NLP algorithm, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), was published in late 2018. BERT set new performance standards on tasks as diverse as question answering, named entity recognition, speech recognition, and more. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop a BERT-based system to automatically extract detailed tumor site and histology information from free-text oncological pathology reports. METHODS: We pursued three specific aims: extract accurate tumor site and histology descriptions from free-text pathology reports, accommodate the diverse terminology used to indicate the same pathology, and provide accurate standardized tumor site and histology codes for use by downstream applications. We first trained a base language model to comprehend the technical language in pathology reports. This involved unsupervised learning on a training corpus of 275,605 electronic pathology reports from 164,531 unique patients that included 121 million words. Next, we trained a question-and-answer (Q&A) model that connects a Q&A layer to the base pathology language model to answer pathology questions. Our Q&A system was designed to search for the answers to two predefined questions in each pathology report: What organ contains the tumor? and What is the kind of tumor or carcinoma? This involved supervised training on 8197 pathology reports, each with ground truth answers to these 2 questions determined by certified tumor registrars. The data set included 214 tumor sites and 193 histologies. The tumor site and histology phrases extracted by the Q&A model were used to predict International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3), site and histology codes. This involved fine-tuning two additional BERT models: one to predict site codes and another to predict histology codes. Our final system includes a network of 3 BERT-based models. We call this CancerBERT network (caBERTnet). We evaluated caBERTnet using a sequestered test data set of 2050 pathology reports with ground truth answers determined by certified tumor registrars. RESULTS: caBERTnet's accuracies for predicting group-level site and histology codes were 93.53% (1895/2026) and 97.6% (1993/2042), respectively. The top 5 accuracies for predicting fine-grained ICD-O-3 site and histology codes with 5 or more samples each in the training data set were 92.95% (1794/1930) and 96.01% (1853/1930), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an NLP system that outperforms existing algorithms at predicting ICD-O-3 codes across an extensive range of tumor sites and histologies. Our new system could help reduce treatment delays, increase enrollment in clinical trials of new therapies, and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Injury is an important public health problem in the pediatric age group and one of the leading global causes of morbidity and mortality. The fact that pediatric trauma has a significant impact on patients, families, and countries shows the need for a better understanding of this phenomenon. This study investigates the demographic characteristics, reasons for admission to the hospital, and diagnoses of pediatric trauma patients who received prehospital emergency health services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a retrospective observational study and included all patients under the age of 18 who received emergency healthcare due to trauma and were registered in the Emergency Health Automation System after a call was placed to the emergency call center between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2022. Information such as the reason for calling an ambulance, ICD-10 diagnosis codes, mechanism of injury, time of arrival at the scene, transport duration from the scene to the hospital, and reasons for interfacility transfers were collected for all patients. RESULTS: A total of 37,420 patients were included in the analysis. Seventeen patients were found dead at the scene of the trauma and 35 patients experienced cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital from the scene. The difference between age groups in terms of time from arrival at the scene to arrival at the hospital was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Falls were the most common cause of trauma in all age groups, followed by traffic accidents. Patients requiring a specialist and transferred primarily for fall-related injuries were in direct proportion to the total number of cases (65.0%, n = 1838), followed by cases of traffic accidents and sports injuries. Most of the secondary transports were made to a training and research hospital or state hospital. CONCLUSION: Targeted preventive measures and community education should address the specific causes of trauma that are more prevalent in certain age groups. Early identification of special patient groups that typically require secondary transport can reduce mortality and morbidity related to trauma by facilitating direct transfers to appropriate hospitals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to define the national incidence of enterotomy (ENT) during minimally invasive ventral hernia repair (MIS-VHR) and evaluate impact on short-term outcomes. METHODS: The 2016-2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried using ICD-10 codes for MIS-VHR and enterotomy. All patients had 3-months follow-up. Patients were stratified by elective status; patients without ENT (No-ENT) were compared against ENT patients. RESULTS: In total, 30,025 patients underwent LVHR and ENT occurred in 388 (1.3%) patients; 19,188 (63.9%) cases were elective including 244 elective-ENT patients. Incidence was similar between elective versus non-elective cohorts (1.27% vs 1.33%; p = 0.674). Compared to laparoscopy, ENT was more common during robotic procedures (1.2% vs 1.7%; p = 0.004). Comparison of elective-No-ENT vs elective-ENT showed that elective-ENT patients had a longer median LOS (2 vs 5 days; p < 0.001), higher mean hospital cost ($51,656 vs $76,466; p < 0.001), increased rates of mortality (0.3% vs 2.9%; p < 0.001), and higher 3-month readmission (10.1% vs 13.9%; p = 0.048). Non-elective cohort comparison demonstrated non-elective-ENT patients had a longer median LOS (4 vs 7 days; p < 0.001), higher mean hospital cost ($58,379 vs $87,850; p < 0.001), increased rates of mortality (0.7% vs 2.1%;p < 0.001), and higher 3-month readmission (13.6% vs 22.2%; p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 95% CI), higher odds of enterotomy were associated with robotic-assisted procedures (1.386, 1.095-1.754; p = 0.007) and older age (1.014, 1.004-1.024; p = 0.006). Lower odds of ENT were associated with BMI > 25 kg/m CONCLUSION: Inadvertent ENT occurred in 1.3% of MIS-VHRs, had similar rates between elective and urgent cases, but was more common for robotic procedures. ENT patients had a longer LOS, and increased cost and infection, readmission, re-operation and mortality rates.

AB  - International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code is an important label of electronic health record. The automatic ICD code assignment based on the narrative of clinical documents is an essential task which has drawn much attention recently. When Chinese clinical notes are the input corpus, the nature of Chinese brings some issues that need to be considered, such as the accuracy of word segmentation and the representation of single Chinese characters which contain semantics. Taking the lengthy text of patient notes and the representation of Chinese words into account, we present a multilayer attention bidirectional recurrent neural network (MA-BiRNN) model to implement the assignment of disease codes. A hierarchical approach is used to represent the feature of discharge summaries without manual feature engineering. The combination of character level embedding and word level embedding can improve the representation of words. Attention mechanism is introduced into bidirectional long short term memory networks, which helps to solve the performance dropping problem when plain recurrent neural networks encounter long text sequences. The experiment is carried out on a real-world dataset containing 7732 admission records in Chinese and 1177 unique ICD-10 labels. The proposed model achieves 0.639 and 0.766 in F1-score on full-level code and block-level code, respectively. It outperforms the baseline neural network models and achieves the lowest Hamming loss value. Ablation analysis indicates that the multilevel attention mechanism plays a decisive role in the system for dealing with Chinese clinical notes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative risky alcohol use is one of the most common surgical risk factors. Accurate and early identification of risky alcohol use could enhance surgical safety. Artificial Intelligence-based approaches, such as natural language processing (NLP), provide an innovative method to identify alcohol-related risks from patients' electronic health records (EHR) before surgery. METHODS: Clinical notes (n = 53,629) from pre-operative patients in a tertiary care facility were analyzed for evidence of risky alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. One hundred of these records were reviewed by experts and labeled for comparison. A rule-based NLP model was built, and we assessed the clinical notes for the entire population. Additionally, we assessed each record for the presence or absence of alcohol-related International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes as an additional comparator. RESULTS: NLP correctly identified 87% of the human-labeled patients classified with risky alcohol use. In contrast, diagnosis codes alone correctly identified only 29% of these patients. In terms of specificity, NLP correctly identified 84% of the non-risky cohort, while diagnosis codes correctly identified 90% of this cohort. In the analysis of the full dataset, the NLP-based approach identified three times more patients with risky alcohol use than ICD codes. CONCLUSIONS: NLP, an artificial intelligence-based approach, efficiently and accurately identifies alcohol-related risk in patients' EHRs. This approach could supplement other alcohol screening tools to identify patients in need of intervention, treatment, and/or postoperative withdrawal prophylaxis. Alcohol-related ICD diagnosis had limited utility relative to NLP, which extracts richer information within clinical notes to classify patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: Identification of patients for epidemiologic research through administrative coding has important limitations. We investigated the feasibility of a search based on natural language processing (NLP) on the text sections of electronic health records for identification of patients with septic shock. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Results of an explicit search strategy (using explicit concept retrieval) and a combined search strategy (using both explicit and implicit concept retrieval) were compared to hospital ICD-9 based administrative coding and to our department's own prospectively compiled infection database. RESULTS: Of 8911 patients admitted to the medical or surgical ICU, 1023 (11.5%) suffered from septic shock according to the combined search strategy. This was significantly more than those identified by the explicit strategy (518, 5.8%), by hospital administrative coding (549, 5.8%) or by our own prospectively compiled database (609, 6.8%) (p < .001). Sensitivity and specificity of the automated combined search strategy were 72.7% (95%CI 69.0%-76.2%) and 93.0% (95%CI 92.4%-93.6%), compared to 56.0% (95%CI 52.0%-60.0%) and 97.5% (95%CI 97.1%-97.8%) for hospital administrative coding. CONCLUSIONS: An automated search strategy based on a combination of explicit and implicit concept retrieval is feasible to screen electronic health records for septic shock and outperforms an administrative coding based explicit approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of acute kidney injury (AKI) is important for safe clinical practice. NHS England is implementing a nationwide automated AKI detection system based on changes in blood creatinine. Little has been reported on the similarities and differences of AKI patients detected by this algorithm and other definitions of AKI in the literature. METHODS: We assessed the NHS England AKI algorithm and other definitions using routine biochemistry in our own health authority in Scotland in 2003 (adult population 438 332). Linked hospital episode codes (ICD-10) were used to identify patients where AKI was a major clinical diagnosis. We compared how well the algorithm detected this subset of AKI patients in comparison to other definitions of AKI. We also evaluated the potential 'alert burden' from using the NHS England algorithm in comparison to other AKI definitions. RESULTS: Of 127 851 patients with at least one blood test in 2003, the NHS England AKI algorithm identified 5565 patients. The combined NHS England algorithm criteria detected 91.2% (87.6-94.0) of patients who had an ICD-10 AKI code and this was better than any individual AKI definition. Some of those not captured could be identified by algorithm modifications to identify AKI in retrospect after recovery, but this would not be practical in real-time. Any modifications also increased the number of alerted patients (2-fold in the most sensitive model). CONCLUSIONS: The NHS England AKI algorithm performs well as a diagnostic adjunct in clinical practice. In those without baseline data, AKI may only be seen in biochemistry in retrospect, therefore proactive clinical care remains essential. An alternative algorithm could increase the diagnostic sensitivity, but this would also produce a much greater burden of patient alerts.

AB  - Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with early intervention often being crucial. Research into the underpinnings of glaucoma often relies on electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patients with glaucoma and their subtypes. However, current methods for identifying glaucoma patients from EHRs are often inaccurate or infeasible at scale, relying on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes or manual chart reviews. To address this limitation, we introduce (1) OphthaBERT, a powerful general clinical ophthalmology language model trained on over 2 million diverse clinical notes, and (2) a fine-tuned variant of OphthaBERT that automatically extracts binary and subtype glaucoma diagnoses from clinical notes. The base OphthaBERT model is a robust encoder, outperforming state-of-the-art clinical encoders in masked token prediction on out-of-distribution ophthalmology clinical notes and binary glaucoma classification with limited data. We report significant binary classification performance improvements in low-data regimes (p < 0.001, Bonferroni corrected). OphthaBERT is also able to achieve superior classification performance for both binary and subtype diagnosis, outperforming even fine-tuned large decoder-only language models at a fraction of the computational cost. We demonstrate a 0.23-point increase in macro-F1 for subtype diagnosis over ICD codes and strong binary classification performance when externally validated at Wilmer Eye Institute. OphthaBERT provides an interpretable, equitable framework for general ophthalmology language modeling and automated glaucoma diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic volume is enlarged in acute pancreatitis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether there was a difference in pancreatic volume between survivors and non-survivors with acute pancreatitis using computer-generated 3D imaging. METHOD: This single-center retrospective observational cohort study was conducted between January 2015 and December 2020. The hospital automation system was used to get the patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis by using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (ninth edition, code 577.0 or 10th version, code K 85.0) codes. The patients' pancreatic volumes, computed tomography severity index (CTSI), and modified computed tomography severity index (mCTSI) scores were calculated using the data obtained from the hospital automation system. The pancreatic volumes of the patients were measured using the computer-generated 3D imaging method. Pancreatic volume, CTSI, and mCTSI were then statistically compared in terms of mortality prediction by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Of the 143 patients, 57.34% were female and 42.66% were male. The cut-off value of pancreatic volume in determining mortality was>81.5 cm CONCLUSION: Although CTSI scores pancreatic enlargement and mCTSI scores pancreatic necrosis and inflammation, the pancreatic volume value is not clearly scored in both. In this study population, pancreatic volume above 81.5 cm was associated with increased mortality. Both CTSI and mCTSI scores outperformed pancreatic volume in predicting mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Data and Connectivity COVID-19 Vaccines Pharmacovigilance (DaC-VaP) UK-wide collaboration was created to monitor vaccine uptake and effectiveness and provide pharmacovigilance using routine clinical and administrative data. To monitor these, pooled analyses may be needed. However, variation in terminologies present a barrier as England uses the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), while the rest of the United Kingdom uses the Read v2 terminology in primary care. The availability of data sources is not uniform across the United Kingdom. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use the concept mappings in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) to identify common concepts recorded and to report these in a repeated cross-sectional study. We planned to do this for vaccine coverage and 2 adverse events of interest (AEIs), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and anaphylaxis. We identified concept mappings to SNOMED CT, Read v2, the World Health Organization's International Classification of Disease Tenth Revision (ICD-10) terminology, and the UK Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d). METHODS: Exposures and outcomes of interest to DaC-VaP for pharmacovigilance studies were selected. Mappings of these variables to different terminologies used across the United Kingdom's devolved nations' health services were identified from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Automated Terminology Harmonization, Extraction, and Normalization for Analytics (ATHENA) online browser. Lead analysts from each nation then confirmed or added to the mappings identified. These mappings were then used to report AEIs in a common format. We reported rates for windows of 0-2 and 3-28 days postvaccine every 28 days. RESULTS: We listed the mappings between Read v2, SNOMED CT, ICD-10, and dm+d. For vaccine exposure, we found clear mapping from OMOP to our clinical terminologies, though dm+d had codes not listed by OMOP at the time of searching. We found a list of CVST and anaphylaxis codes. For CVST, we had to use a broader cerebral venous thrombosis conceptual approach to include Read v2. We identified 56 SNOMED CT codes, of which we selected 47 (84%), and 15 Read v2 codes. For anaphylaxis, our refined search identified 60 SNOMED CT codes and 9 Read v2 codes, of which we selected 10 (17%) and 4 (44%), respectively, to include in our repeated cross-sectional studies. CONCLUSIONS: This approach enables the use of mappings to different terminologies within the OMOP CDM without the need to catalogue an entire database. However, Read v2 has less granular concepts than some terminologies, such as SNOMED CT. Additionally, the OMOP CDM cannot compensate for limitations in the clinical coding system. Neither Read v2 nor ICD-10 is sufficiently granular to enable CVST to be specifically flagged. Hence, any pooled analysis will have to be at the less specific level of cerebrovascular venous thrombosis. Overall, the mappings within this CDM are useful, and our method could be used for rapid collaborations where there are only a limited number of concepts to pool.

AB  - When studying emergency department (ED) visits, electronic health record systems of hospitals provide a good basis for retrospective studies. However, many intoxication patients presenting to the ED, may not be identified retrospectively if only a single search method is applied. In this study, a new four-way combined patient search method was used to retrospectively identify intoxication patients presenting to the ED. The search included reason for admission to the ED, laboratory results related to intoxication diagnostics, ICD-10 codes, and a novel free word search (FWS) of patient records. After the automated search, the researcher read the medical records of potential substance abuse patients to form comprehensive profiles and remove irrelevant cases. The addition of a free word search identified 36% more substance abuse patients than the combination of the other three methods mentioned above. Patients identified by the FWS search alone were generally admitted to the ED for trauma or mental health problems and were often found to be heavily under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. The main intoxicants were ethanol and benzodiazepines. The free word search was highly complementary to traditional patient search methods, highlighting the importance of the combined patient search method in retrospective data collection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment delays for refractory convulsive status epilepticus (RCSE) are associated with worse outcomes. In the United States, treatment for pediatric RCSE is slower than guidelines recommend. To address this gap, the American Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society (AAN/CNS) developed a quality measure: the percentage of RCSE patients that receive third-line treatment within 60 minutes. We aimed to develop computable phenotypes for convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) and RCSE to automate calculation of the quality measure. METHODS: From an observational cohort of children presenting to the emergency department for seizures or epilepsy, we identified presentations of RCSE and its precursors: CSE and benzodiazepine-resistant status epilepticus (BRSE). These served as a gold standard for computable phenotype development. Using multivariate analyses, we constructed and evaluated statistical models for case identification. We then evaluated adherence to the AAN/CNS RCSE quality measure. RESULTS: From 664 charts, we identified 56 patients with CSE, 36 with BRSE, and 18 with RCSE. Four predictors were used: International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and receiving first-, second-, or third-line agents shortly after presentation to the emergency department (ED). Combinations of these predictors identified CSE with 84% sensitivity and 81% positive predictive value (PPV), BRSE with 67% sensitivity and 89% PPV, and RCSE with 94% sensitivity and 85% PPV. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) time to treatment for first-line agent was 13 (5-27) minutes for CSE, second-line for BRSE was 24 (9.5-43.5) minutes, and third-line for RCSE was 52 (27-87) minutes. Sixty percent of RCSE patients received a third-line agent within 60 minutes of ED arrival. SIGNIFICANCE: RCSE and its precursors can be identified automatically with high fidelity allowing automated calculation of time to treatment and the RCSE quality measure. This has the potential to facilitate quality improvement work and improve care for RCSE.

AB  - This article describes the implementation of a computerised system for coding the cause of death from death registrations in England and Wales since the beginning of 1993, and the impact this has had on national cause of death statistics. Overall the automated system has been effective and reliable at deriving ICD-9 codes for the underlying cause of death and other conditions mentioned on the certificate. Automation increases the consistency and international comparability of cause of death coding. However, it has led to discontinuities in time trends between 1992 and 1993, which are explored here. The largest effect was related to expected changes in the application of ICD-9 selection rule 3. However there were other effects which were not expected. The automated system does not deal adequately with external causes of death, which are certified after coroner's inquest, and ONS has reverted to coding these clerically. Lessons for the implementation of ICD-10 for mortality have been learnt.

AB  - Medical coding involves assigning codes to clinical free-text documents, specifically medical records that average over 3,000 markers, in order to track patient diagnoses and treatments. This is typically accomplished through manual assignments by healthcare professionals. To improve efficiency and accuracy while reducing the workload on these professionals, researchers have employed a multi-label classification approach. Since the long-tail phenomenon impacts tens of thousands of ICD codes, whereby only a few codes (representative of common diseases) are frequently assigned, while the majority of codes (representative of rare diseases) are infrequently assigned, this paper presents an LCDL model that addresses the challenge at hand by examining the LongFormer pre-trained language model and the disease label co-occurrence map. To enhance the performance of automated medical coding in the biomedical domain, hierarchies with medical knowledge, synonyms and abbreviations are introduced, improving the medical knowledge representation. Test evaluations are extensively conducted on the benchmark dataset MIMIC-III, and obtained the competitive performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (c-SLE) have higher rates of depression than their peers, which has been associated with worse medical outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative that their mental health be addressed. We utilized quality improvement (QI) methodology to automate mental health screening for patients with lupus within a pediatric rheumatology clinic. The retrospective cohort study aims to evaluate the association between mental health screening outcomes and demographics, medications, and disease activity measures in patients with childhood lupus. METHODS: The mental health QI team at a quaternary pediatric rheumatology center implemented an automated process for mental health screening in patients with c-SLE. Patients seen between 2017 and June 2023 with a diagnosis of c-SLE were identified using International Classification of Disease -Clinical Modification (ICD-CM) codes. Disease activity was assessed with the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI 2K). Medications were identified on outpatient and inpatient orders for conventional synthetic and biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, and aspirin. Mental health screening was accomplished with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate linear regression were used. RESULTS: Between January 2017 and June 2023, 117 patients with c-SLE (41% with lupus nephritis) completed 534 total screenings. Each patient completed PHQ screenings, a median of 5 [interquartile range 2, 6] times. Screening increased when the screening process was automated. Those who were Black, female, or prescribed leflunomide, mycophenolate, and corticosteroids had higher PHQ scores. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health support is essential for patients with chronic rheumatologic diseases such as SLE. Sustainable processes for quickly identifying depression are needed for optimal care of patients with SLE. Our process of automated, streamlined mental health screening successfully increased the screening of patients with SLE at every visit and led to timely interventions for positive PHQ scores. Higher PHQ scores were correlated with patients on leflunomide, mycophenolate, and corticosteroids. Future research should identify modifiable risk factors for high PHQ scores that the medical team can target.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of seven social factors using physician notes as compared to claims and structured electronic health records (EHRs) data and the resulting association with 30-day readmissions. STUDY SETTING: A multihospital academic health system in southeastern Massachusetts. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study of 49,319 patients with cardiovascular disease admitted from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, using multivariable logistic regression to adjust for patient characteristics. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: All-payer claims, EHR data, and physician notes extracted from a centralized clinical registry. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All seven social characteristics were identified at the highest rates in physician notes. For example, we identified 14,872 patient admissions with poor social support in physician notes, increasing the prevalence from 0.4 percent using ICD-9 codes and structured EHR data to 16.0 percent. Compared to an 18.6 percent baseline readmission rate, risk-adjusted analysis showed higher readmission risk for patients with housing instability (readmission rate 24.5 percent; p < .001), depression (20.6 percent; p < .001), drug abuse (20.2 percent; p = .01), and poor social support (20.0 percent; p = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The seven social risk factors studied are substantially more prevalent than represented in administrative data. Automated methods for analyzing physician notes may enable better identification of patients with social needs.

AB  - Information in claims databases resides in data patterns rather than in data elements. Finding this information requires new terminology, a willingness to pose questions of form rather than specific hypotheses, and a quality control system that elevates the correctness of data relations above the validity of single facts. The language of claims data is a newspeak of CPT (Current Procedural Terminology), HCPCS (Health Care Financing Agency Common Procedure Coding System), ICD (International Classification of Disease), and NDC (National Drug Codes) for pharmaceutical codes. The techniques of pattern discovery are really ways of asking the data for classes of relations, and they vary in their reliance on external information. Sometimes, the question is entirely constrained by preceding factors. Other times we may recast the natural history of disease into a claims context and ask the data to give us the shape of disease evolution. We can use highly automated systems to evaluate the relations between prespecified factors, or empirical techniques to search out common relations that we have not specified in advance. Using massive data sets requires that quality control corresponds to the nature of the high-level information that we derive from large databases.

AB  - PURPOSE: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological malignancy in women, with increasing incidence in the last decades. Surgical therapy is the mainstay of the initial management. The present study analyzed the evolving trends of surgical therapy in Germany in patients diagnosed with EC recorded in a nationwide registry. METHODS: All patients with the diagnosis of EC undergoing open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery between 2007 and 2018 were identified by international classification of diseases (ICD) or specific operational codes (OPS) within the database of the German federal bureau of statistics. RESULTS: A total of 85,204 patients underwent surgical therapy for EC. Beginning with 2013, minimal-invasive surgical therapy was the leading approach for patients with EC. Open surgery was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality (1.3% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001), of prolonged mechanical ventilation (1.3% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001), and of prolonged hospital stay (13.7 ± 10.2 days vs. 7.2 ± 5.3 days, p < 0.001) compared to laparoscopic surgery. A total of 1551 (0.04%) patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery were converted to laparotomy. Procedure costs were highest for laparotomy, followed by robotic-assisted laparoscopy and laparoscopy (8286 ± 7533€ vs. 7083 ± 3893€ vs. 6047 ± 3509€, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that minimal-invasive surgery has increasingly become the standard surgical procedure for patients with EC in Germany. Furthermore, minimal-invasive surgery had superior in-hospital outcomes compared to laparotomy. Moreover, the use of robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery is increasing, with a comparable in-hospital safety profile to conventional laparoscopy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is a recently developed tool that uses ICD-10 codes to measure patient frailty. However, the effectiveness of HFRS has not yet been assessed in meningioma patients specifically. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of HFRS in predicting surgical outcomes for patients with meningiomas. METHODS: This retrospective study utilized data from patients undergoing meningioma resection at a single institution (2017-2019). Data were obtained through a combination of automated data retrieval and manual chart review. Bivariate logistic regression was used to assess the prognostic ability of several frailty indices for predicting postoperative outcomes. Further, discrimination for each model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Generalized linear models with gamma error distributions and a log-link function were used to model hospital length of stay (LOS), total charges, complications, and disposition. RESULTS: A total of 464 meningioma patients (mean age 58.20 years, 72.8 % female, 66.4 % white) were included. HFRS had a significantly greater AUROC when compared to ASA (p = 0.0074) for postoperative complications, and HFRS significantly outperformed ASA (p = 0.0021) and mFI-5 (p = 0.018) when predicting nonroutine discharge. On multivariate analysis, increasing HFRS scores were significantly and independently associated with greater LOS (p < 0.0001), higher hospital charges (p < 0.0001), higher odds of postoperative complications (OR = 1.05, p = 0.019), and nonroutine discharge (OR = 1.12, p < 0.0001). The HFRS was non-inferior compared to the mFI-5, CCI, ASA and mFI-11 in terms of model discrimination. CONCLUSION: HFRS effectively predicts postoperative outcomes for meningiomas and outperforms other indices in predicting complications and nonroutine discharge. This novel index may be used to improve clinical decision-making and reduce adverse postoperative outcomes among meningioma patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a complication of advanced peripheral artery disease (PAD) with diagnosis based on the presence of clinical signs and symptoms. However, automated identification of cases from electronic health records (EHRs) is challenging due to absence of a single definitive International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 or ICD-10) code for CLI. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we extend a previously validated natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for PAD identification to develop and validate a subphenotyping NLP algorithm (CLI-NLP) for identification of CLI cases from clinical notes. We compared performance of the CLI-NLP algorithm with CLI-related ICD-9 billing codes. The gold standard for validation was human abstraction of clinical notes from EHRs. Compared to billing codes the CLI-NLP algorithm had higher positive predictive value (PPV) (CLI-NLP 96%, billing codes 67%, p < 0.001), specificity (CLI-NLP 98%, billing codes 74%, p < 0.001) and F1-score (CLI-NLP 90%, billing codes 76%, p < 0.001). The sensitivity of these two methods was similar (CLI-NLP 84%; billing codes 88%; p < 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: The CLI-NLP algorithm for identification of CLI from narrative clinical notes in an EHR had excellent PPV and has potential for translation to patient care as it will enable automated identification of CLI cases for quality projects, clinical decision support tools and support a learning healthcare system.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: With its increasingly widespread adoption, electronic health records (EHR) have enabled phenotypic information extraction at an unprecedented granularity and scale. However, often a medical concept (e.g. diagnosis, prescription, symptom) is described in various synonyms across different EHR systems, hindering data integration for signal enhancement and complicating dimensionality reduction for knowledge discovery. Despite existing ontologies and hierarchies, tremendous human effort is needed for curation and maintenance - a process that is both unscalable and susceptible to subjective biases. This paper aims to develop a data-driven approach to automate grouping medical terms into clinically relevant concepts by combining multiple up-to-date data sources in an unbiased manner. METHODS: We present a novel data-driven grouping approach - multi-view banded spectral clustering (mvBSC) combining summary data from multiple healthcare systems. The proposed method consists of a banding step that leverages the prior knowledge from the existing coding hierarchy, and a combining step that performs spectral clustering on an optimally weighted matrix. RESULTS: We apply the proposed method to group ICD-9 and ICD-10-CM codes together by integrating data from two healthcare systems. We show grouping results and hierarchies for 13 representative disease categories. Individual grouping qualities were evaluated using normalized mutual information, adjusted Rand index, and F CONCLUSION: The proposed approach, by systematically leveraging multiple data sources, is able to overcome bias while maximizing consensus to achieve generalizability. It has the advantage of being efficient, scalable, and adaptive to the evolving human knowledge reflected in the data, showing a significant step toward automating medical knowledge integration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We studied changes in death statistics by deaths from diabetes mellitus (DM) after introduction of mandatory online death certificate (DC) submission in Norway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on deaths with DM mentioned in the DCs from year 2017 (DCs submitted on paper) to 2022 (DCs submitted online) was collected from the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry (NCoDR), Sex, age, year of death and type of DC (paper (pDC) vs electronic (eDC)) was registered. In DCs with DM as underlying cause of death (UCOD), all codes (International classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10)), their original position in the DC and place of death were collected. DM was classified as type-1, type-2 and other. Differences between 2017 and 2022 according to use of unspecified DM diagnoses, number of changed diagnoses after automated processing, correct positioning of UCOD in DC, total number of diagnoses, and use of ill- defined diagnoses were analyzed. Generalized linear models for binomial outcome with log link were used to fit mortality data and test differences between electronic and paper registration systems, two-sample t-test and linear regressions for analysis of differences in number of diagnoses. RESULTS: 229 807 deaths were registered, including 3 864 DM deaths. Online DC submission increased from 0 in 2017 to 95% in 2022. In 2022, DCs with DM as UCOD showed significant less use of unspecified diabetes diagnoses (Relative risk,RR: 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14-0.22), reduced need for change of diagnoses after automated processing (RR: 0.52, CI: 0.46-0.59), reduced number of diagnoses (CI: -0.7 to -0.38), and less use of ill-defined diagnoses (RR: 0.83, CI: 0.71-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of online cause of death submission in Norway improved the quality of registration of deaths from diabetes.

AB  - Cohort identification is an important step in conducting clinical research studies. Use of ICD-9 codes to identify disease cohorts is a common approach that can yield satisfactory results in certain conditions; however, for many use-cases more accurate methods are required. In this study, we propose a bootstrapping method that supplements ICD-9 codes with lab results, medications, etc. to build classification models that can be used to identify cohorts more accurately. The proposed method does not require prior information about the true class of the patients. We used the method to identify Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Hyperlipidemia (HL) patient cohorts from a database of 800 thousand patients. Evaluation results show that the method identified 11,000 patients who did not have DM related ICD-9 codes as positive for DM and 52,000 patients without HL codes as positive for HL. A review of 400 patient charts (200 patients for each condition) by two clinicians shows that in both the conditions studied, the labeling assigned by the proposed approach is more consistent with that of the clinicians compared to labeling through ICD-9 codes. The method is reasonably automated and, we believe, holds potential for inexpensive, more accurate cohort identification.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is challenging to prognosticate hospitalised older adults. Delayed recognition of end-of-life leads to failure in delivering appropriate palliative care and increases healthcare utilisation. Most mortality prediction tools specific for older adults require additional manual input, resulting in poor uptake. By leveraging on electronic health records, we aim to create an automatable mortality prediction tool for hospitalised older adults. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed electronic records of general medicine patients ≥75 years at a tertiary hospital between April-September 2021. Demographics, comorbidities, ICD-codes, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Hospital Frailty Risk Score, mortality and resource utilization were collected. We defined early deaths, late deaths and survivors as patients who died within 30 days, 1 year, and lived beyond 1 year of admission, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race, frailty, and CCI. The final prediction model was created using a stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1,224 patients, 168 (13.7%) died early and 370 (30.2%) died late. From adjusted multivariate regression, risk of early death was significantly associated with ≥85 years, intermediate or high frail risk, CCI > 6, cardiovascular risk factors, AMI and pneumonia. For late death, risk factors included ≥85 years, intermediate frail risk, CCI >6, delirium, diabetes, AMI and pneumonia. Our mortality prediction tool which scores 1 point each for age, pneumonia and AMI had an AUC of 0.752 for early death and 0.691 for late death. CONCLUSION: Our mortality prediction model is a proof-of-concept demonstrating the potential for automated medical alerts to guide physicians towards personalised care for hospitalised older adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to estimate the incidence of lung disease among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Using Swedish register data, we identified patients with SLE and pulmonary diagnoses from the National Patient Register through ICD codes. We matched patients with SLE with individuals from the general population. Patients with SLE with a history of pulmonary disease were excluded. Incidence rates (IR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated overall and by type of pulmonary disease for incident (2003-2013) and prevalent SLE separately. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI of the association between SLE and pulmonary disease were estimated using adjusted Cox regression models. Sensitivity analyses using a semi-automated approach to quantitative probabilistic bias analysis accounted for potential bias due to unmeasured confounding by smoking. RESULTS: There were 3209 incident and 6908 prevalent cases of SLE identified. The IRs for pulmonary disease were similar in prevalent and incident SLE (∼14 cases per 1000 person-years). Patients with incident SLE had a nearly sixfold higher rate of pulmonary disease compared to the non-SLE population (HR 5.8 (95% CI 4.8-7.0)). Incident and prevalent SLE was associated with an increased rate of interstitial lung disease (HR 19.0 (95% CI 10.7-34.0) and 14.3 (95% CI 10.8-18.8), respectively). Bias due to unmeasured confounding by smoking was unlikely to explain our findings. CONCLUSION: Lung disease is relatively common in patients with SLE compared to the general population. Clinicians caring for patients with SLE should have heightened suspicion of lung disease, including interstitial lung disease, even early within the disease course or at the time of diagnosis of SLE.

AB  - Pathology reports represent a primary source of information for cancer registries. Hospitals routinely process high volumes of free-text reports, a valuable source of information regarding cancer diagnosis for improving clinical care and supporting research. Information extraction and coding of textual unstructured data is typically a manual, labour-intensive process. There is a need to develop automated approaches to extract meaningful information from such texts in a reliable and accurate way. In this scenario, Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms offer a unique opportunity to automatically encode the unstructured reports into structured data, thus representing a potential powerful alternative to expensive manual processing. However, notwithstanding the increasing interest in this area, there is still limited availability of NLP approaches for pathology reports in languages other than English, including Italian, to date. The aim of our work was to develop an automated algorithm based on NLP techniques, able to identify and classify the morphological content of pathology reports in the Italian language with micro-averaged performance scores higher than 95%. Specifically, a novel, domain-specific classifier that uses linguistic rules was developed and tested on 27,239 pathology reports from a single Italian oncological centre, following the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology morphology classification standard (ICD-O-M). The proposed classification algorithm achieved successful results with a micro-F

AB  - BACKGROUND:  Contemporary pulmonary embolism (PE) research, in many cases, relies on data from electronic health records (EHRs) and administrative databases that use International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Natural language processing (NLP) tools can be used for automated chart review and patient identification. However, there remains uncertainty with the validity of ICD-10 codes or NLP algorithms for patient identification. METHODS:  The PE-EHR+ study has been designed to validate ICD-10 codes as Principal Discharge Diagnosis, or Secondary Discharge Diagnoses, as well as NLP tools set out in prior studies to identify patients with PE within EHRs. Manual chart review by two independent abstractors by predefined criteria will be the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values will be determined. We will assess the discriminatory function of code subgroups for intermediate- and high-risk PE. In addition, accuracy of NLP algorithms to identify PE from radiology reports will be assessed. RESULTS:  A total of 1,734 patients from the Mass General Brigham health system have been identified. These include 578 with ICD-10 Principal Discharge Diagnosis codes for PE, 578 with codes in the secondary position, and 578 without PE codes during the index hospitalization. Patients within each group were selected randomly from the entire pool of patients at the Mass General Brigham health system. A smaller subset of patients will also be identified from the Yale-New Haven Health System. Data validation and analyses will be forthcoming. CONCLUSIONS:  The PE-EHR+ study will help validate efficient tools for identification of patients with PE in EHRs, improving the reliability of efficient observational studies or randomized trials of patients with PE using electronic databases.

AB  - Whether automated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting for patients is associated with improved provider recognition of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as measured by diagnostic coding of CKD in those with laboratory evidence of the disease, has not been explored in a poor, ethnically diverse, high-risk urban patient population. A retrospective cohort of 237 adult patients (≥ 20 years) with incident CKD (≥ 1 eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), followed by ≥ 2 eGFRs <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) ≥ 3 months apart)-pre- or post automated eGFR reporting-was identified within the San Francisco Department of Public Health Community Health Network (January 2005-July 2009). Patients were considered coded if any ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes for CKD (585.x), other kidney disease (580.x-581.x, 586.x), or diabetes (250.4) or hypertension (403.x, 404.x) CKD were present in the medical record within 6 months of incident CKD. Multivariable logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for CKD coding. We found that, pre-eGFR reporting, 42.5 % of incident CKD patients were coded for CKD. Female gender, increased age, and non-Black race were associated with lower serum creatinine and lower prevalence of coding but comparable eGFR. Prevalence of coding was not statistically significantly higher overall (49.6 %, P = 0.27) or in subgroups after the institution of automated eGFR reporting. However, gaps in coding by age and gender were narrowed post-eGFR, even after adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics: 47.9 % of those <65 and 30.3 % of those ≥ 65 were coded pre-eGFR, compared to 49.0 % and 52.0 % post-eGFR (OR = 0.43 and 1.16); similarly, 53.2 % of males and 25.4 % of females were coded pre-eGFR compared to 52.8 % and 44.0 % post-eGFR (OR 0.28 vs. 0.64). Blacks were more likely to be coded in the post-eGFR period: OR = 1.08 and 1.43 (P (interaction) > 0.05). Automated eGFR reporting may help improve CKD recognition, but it is not sufficient to resolve under identification of CKD by safety net providers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: While a single but truncated ICD code (493) had been widely used for identifying asthma in asthma care and research, it significantly under-identifies asthma. We aimed to develop and validate a diagnostic codes-based algorithm for identifying asthmatics using Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC) as the reference. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study which utilized two different coding systems, the Hospital Adaptation of the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (H-ICDA) and the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The algorithm was developed using two population-based asthma study cohorts, and validated in a validation cohort, a random sample of the 1976-2007 Olmsted County Birth Cohort. Performance of the diagnostic codes-based algorithm for ascertaining asthma status against manual chart review for PAC (gold standard) was assessed by determining both criterion and construct validity. RESULTS: Among eligible 267 subjects of the validation cohort, 50% were male, 70% white, and the median age at last follow-up was 17 (interquartile range, 8.7-24.4) years. Asthma prevalence by PAC through manual chart review was 34%. Sensitivity and specificity of the codes-based algorithm for identifying asthma were 82% and 98% respectively. Associations of asthma-related risk factors with asthma status ascertained by the code-based algorithm were similar to those by the manual review. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic codes-based algorithm for identifying asthmatics improves accuracy of identification of asthma and can be a useful tool for large scale studies in a setting without automated chart review capabilities.

AB  - AIMS: Automated checks for medication-related problems have become a cornerstone of medication safety. In many clinical settings medication checks remain confined to drug-drug interactions because only medication data are available in an adequately coded form, leaving possible contraindicated drug-disease combinations unaccounted for. Therefore, we devised algorithms that identify frequently contraindicated diagnoses based on medication patterns related to these diagnoses. METHODS: We identified drugs that are associated with diseases constituting common contraindications based on their exclusive use for these conditions (such as allopurinol for gout or salbutamol for bronchial obstruction). Expert-based and machine learning algorithms were developed to identify diagnoses based on highly specific medication patterns. The applicability, sensitivity and specificity of the approach were assessed by using an anonymized real-life sample of medication and diagnosis data excerpts from 3506 discharge records of geriatric patients. RESULTS: Depending on the algorithm, the desired focus (i.e., sensitivity vs. specificity) and the disease, we were able to identify the diagnoses gout, epilepsy, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and bronchial obstruction with a specificity of 44.0-99.8% (95% CI 41.7-100.0%) and a sensitivity of 3.8-83.1% (95% CI 1.0-86.1%). Using only medication data, we were able to identify 123 (51.3%) of 240 contraindications identified by experts with access to medication data and diagnoses. CONCLUSION: This study provides a proof of principle that some key diagnosis-related contraindications can be identified based on a patient's medication data alone, while others cannot be identified. This approach offers new opportunities to analyse drug-disease contraindications in community pharmacy or clinical routine data.

AB  - In medical genetics, several systems are used to classify and code genetic disorders for the purpose of automated registration. In the Netherlands, a genetic diagnosis code system has been developed that links a unique four-digit code to a principal description and all current synonyms. The main goal of this coding system is to enable nationwide uniformity of coding, without losing access to information stored in the past, identified by the ICD/BPA code (the International Classification of Diseases as adapted by the British Paediatric Association) and/or the MIM code (McKusick's classification in Mendelian Inheritance in Man). To this effect, the Dutch diagnosis code is cross-referenced with the 2 pre-existing classification systems. Developments in medical genetics make regular updates of all coding systems necessary. In the Netherlands, new diagnosis codes are assigned centrally to preserve uniformity and distributed periodically to all 8 clinical genetic centers. Diagnosis codes are assigned in numerical order of inclusion, enabling quick and easy updates. It is possible to include subclassifications of disorders according to pattern of inheritance, gene location, and gene mutations and to cover all disorders and disorder subtypes which are not clearly distinguished by the 2 pre-existing classification systems. The architecture of the coding system is suitable for international use. It offers a practical solution for clinical geneticists in need of a coding system suitable for clinical use. The use of the diagnosis code will also facilitate reliable comparison of data and nationwide genetic epidemiological studies.

AB  - UNLABELLED: We evaluated strategies to identify and recruit a racially/ethnically diverse cohort of women at high-risk for breast cancer to a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We enrolled 300 high-risk women and 50 healthcare providers to a RCT of standard educational materials alone or in combination with web-based decision support tools. We implemented five strategies to identify high-risk women: (i) recruitment among patients previously enrolled in a study evaluating breast cancer risk; (ii) automated breast cancer risk calculation using information extracted from the electronic health record (EHR); (iii) identification of women with atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 diagnostic codes; (iv) clinical encounters with enrolled healthcare providers; (v) recruitment flyers/online resources. Breast cancer risk was calculated using either the Gail or Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) models. We identified 6,229 high-risk women and contacted 3,459 (56%), of whom 17.2% were identified from prior study cohort, 37.5% through EHR risk information, 14.8% with atypical hyperplasia/LCIS, 29.0% by clinical encounters, and 1.5% through recruitment flyers. Women from the different recruitment sources varied by age and 5-year invasive breast cancer risk. Of 300 enrolled high-risk women, 44.7% came from clinical encounters and 27.3% from prior study cohort. Comparing enrolled with not-enrolled participants, there were significant differences in mean age (57.2 vs. 59.1 years), proportion of non-Whites (41.5% vs. 54.8%), and mean 5-year breast cancer risk (3.0% vs. 2.3%). We identified and successfully recruited diverse high-risk women from multiple sources. These strategies may be implemented in future breast cancer chemoprevention trials. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: We describe five strategies to identify and successfully recruit a large cohort of racially/ethnically diverse high-risk women from multiple sources to a randomized controlled trial evaluating interventions to increase chemoprevention uptake. Findings could inform recruitment efforts for future breast cancer prevention trials to increase recruitment yield of high-risk women.

AB  - Medical coding is essential for healthcare operations yet remains predominantly manual, error-prone (up to 20%), and costly (up to $18.2 billion annually). Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in natural language processing, their application to medical coding has produced limited accuracy. In this study, we evaluated whether fine-tuning LLMs with specialized ICD-10 knowledge can automate code generation across clinical documentation. We adopted a two-phase approach: initial fine-tuning using 74,260 ICD-10 code-description pairs, followed by enhanced training to address linguistic and lexical variations. Evaluations using a proprietary model (GPT-4o mini) on a cloud platform and an open-source model (Llama) on local GPUs demonstrated that initial fine-tuning increased exact matching from <1% to 97%, while enhanced fine-tuning further improved performance in complex scenarios, with real-world clinical notes achieving 69.20% exact match and 87.16% category match. These findings indicate that domain-specific fine-tuned LLMs can reduce manual burdens and improve reliability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Documenting cannabis use is important for patient care, but no formal requirements for consistent reporting exist in primary care. The objective of this study was to understand how cannabis use is documented in primary care electronic medical record (EMR) data. RESULTS: This was a cross-sectional study using de-identified EMR data from over 398,000 patients and 333 primary care providers in Alberta, Canada. An automated pattern-matching algorithm was developed to identify text and ICD-9 diagnostic codes indicating cannabis use in the EMR. There was a total of 11,724 records indicating cannabis use from 4652 patients, representing approximately 1.2% of the patient sample. Commonly used terms and ICD-9 codes included cannabis, marijuana/marihuana, THC, 304.3 and 305.2. Nabilone was the most frequently prescribed cannabinoid medication. Slightly more males and those with a chronic condition had cannabis use recorded more often. Overall, very few patients have cannabis use recorded in primary care EMR data and this is not captured in a systematic way. We propose several strategies to improve the documentation of cannabis use to facilitate more effective clinical care, research, and surveillance.

AB  - Evidence based medicine and health data for policy should update statistical data modeling methods to take advantage of at-scale data. One challenge with at-scale data is information segmentation for clinical presentation discovery and cohort assignment. We use gradient boosting machine (GBM) to segment 94,379,175,015 diagnostic clinical events attributable to 283,632,789 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services beneficiaries over 22 observation years. Diagnostic events were aggregated into attack rates by demography and Phenome-wide association studies (PheWas) codes. Resulting attack rates were then segmented within a user defined clinical status of interest, in this case HIV status. 1,753,647 HIV+ beneficiaries were considered. The GBM model assigned 19,651,408 PheWas attack rates from 69,133,296 ICD attack rates into phenogroups/nodes.

AB  - Some conditions are already known to be associated with an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Other conditions may also be significant indicators of increased risk. The aim of the current study was to identify conditions for inclusion in a fracture prediction model (fracture risk evaluation model [FREM]) for automated case finding of high-risk individuals of hip or major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs). We included the total population of Denmark aged 45+ years (N = 2,495,339). All hospital diagnoses from 1998 to 2012 were used as possible conditions; the primary outcome was MOFs during 2013. Our cohort was split randomly 50/50 into a development and a validation dataset for deriving and validating the predictive model. We applied backward selection on ICD-10 codes (International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision) by logistic regression to develop an age-adjusted and sex-stratified model. The FREM for MOFs included 38 and 43 risk factors for women and men, respectively. Testing FREM for MOFs in the validation cohort showed good accuracy; it produced receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.750 (95% CI, 0.741 to 0.795) and 0.752 (95% CI, 0.743 to 0.761) for women and men, respectively. The FREM for hip fractures included 32 risk factors for both genders and showed an even higher accuracy in the validation cohort as AUCs of 0.874 (95% CI, 0.869 to 0.879) and 0.851 (95% CI, 0.841 to 0.861) for women and men were found, respectively. We have developed and tested a prediction model (FREM) for identifying men and women at high risk of MOFs or hip fractures by using solely existing administrative data. The FREM could be employed either at the point of care integrated into electronic patient record systems to alert physicians or deployed centrally in a national case-finding strategy where patients at high fracture risk could be invited to a focused DXA program. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Functional seizures (formerly psychogenic nonepileptic seizures), paroxysmal episodes that are often similar to epileptic seizures in their clinical presentation and display no aberrant brain electrical patterns, are understudied. Patients experience a long diagnostic delay, few treatment modalities, a high rate of comorbidities, and significant stigma due to the lack of knowledge about functional seizures. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical epidemiology of a population of patients with functional seizures observed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study included patients with functional seizures identified in the VUMC electronic health record (VUMC-EHR) system from October 1989 to October 2018. Patients with epilepsy were excluded from the study and all remaining patients in the VUMC medical center system were used as controls. In total, the study included 1431 patients diagnosed with functional seizures, 2251 with epilepsy and functional seizures, 4715 with epilepsy without functional seizures, and 502 200 control patients who received treatment at VUMC for a minimum of a 3 years. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to March 2020. EXPOSURE: Diagnosis of functional seizures, as identified from the VUMC-EHR system by an automated phenotyping algorithm that incorporated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, Current Procedural Terminology codes, and natural language processing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Associations of functional seizures with comorbidities and risk factors, measured in odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Of 2 346 808 total patients in the VUMC-EHR aged 18 years or older, 3341 patients with functional seizures were identified (period prevalence, 0.14%), 1062 (74.2%) of whom were women and for which the median (interquartile range) age was 49.3 (39.4-59.9) years. This assessment replicated previously reported associations with psychiatric disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.21-1.24; P < 3.02 × 10-5), anxiety (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.15; P < 3.02 × 10-5), and depression (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.15; P < 3.02 × 10-5), and identified novel associations with cerebrovascular disease (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.09; P < 3.02 × 10-5). An association was found between functional seizures and the known risk factor sexual assault trauma (OR, 10.26; 95% CI, 10.09-10.44; P < 3.02 × 10-5), and sexual assault trauma was found to mediate nearly a quarter of the association between female sex and functional seizures in the VUMC-EHR. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case-control study found evidence to support previously reported associations, discovered new associations between functional seizures and PTSD, anxiety, and depression. An association between cerebrovascular disease and functional seizures was also found. Results suggested that sexual trauma may be a mediating factor in the association between female sex and functional seizures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of using ICD-9 codes to identify nonunions (NU) and malunions (MU) among adults with a prior fracture code and to explore case-finding algorithms. STUDY DESIGN: Medical chart review of potential NU (N=300) and MU (N=288) cases. True NU cases had evidence of NU and no evidence of MU in the chart (and vice versa for MUs) or were confirmed by the study clinician. Positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated for ICD-9 codes. Case-finding algorithms were developed by a classification and regression tree analysis using additional automated data, and these algorithms were compared to true case status. SETTING: Group Health Cooperative. RESULTS: Compared to true cases as determined from chart review, the PPV of ICD-9 codes for NU and MU were 89% (95% CI, 85-92%) and 47% (95% CI, 41-53%), respectively. A higher proportion of true cases (NU: 95%; 95% CI, 90-98%; MU: 56%; 95% CI, 47-66%) were found among subjects with 1+ additional codes occurring in the 12months following the initial code. There was no case-finding algorithm for NU developed given the high PPV of ICD-9 codes. For MU, the best case-finding algorithm classified people as an MU case if they had a fracture in the forearm, hand, or skull and had no visit with an NU diagnosis code in the 12-month post MU diagnosis. PPV for this MU case-finding algorithm increased to 84%. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying NUs with its ICD-9 code is reasonable. Identifying MUs with automated data can be improved by using a case-finding algorithm that uses additional information. Further validation of the MU algorithms in different populations is needed, as well as exploration of its performance in a larger sample.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Fecal calprotectin (fCAL) is a noninvasive laboratory test used in the diagnosis and monitoring of IBDs such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The fCAL send-out test that our facility has been offering so far uses an ELISA-based method. In the current study, we sought to validate the performance of a Buhlmann fCAL turbo assay in an automated Abbott Alinity C analyzer (AFCAL) in our core laboratory. Five-day imprecision studies showed good performance for both within-run (5.3%) and between-day (2.5%) measurements. The reportable range was verified as 30-20,000 µg/g. Deming regression and Bland-Altman analysis indicated a strong correlation of r = 0.99 with a low, acceptable bias of 1.8% for AFCAL relative to the predicate Buhlmann fCAL ELISA results. AFCAL's clinical performance was determined retrospectively in 62 patients with ICD codes for IBD. Overall, the implementation of AFCAL in our routine clinical testing has improved our turnaround time, reduced the cost per test, and significantly increased our clinician satisfaction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with critical medical illness, data regarding new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is relatively sparse. This study examines the incidence, associated risk factors, and associated outcomes of NOAF in patients in the medical intensive care unit (MICU). METHODS: This single-center retrospective observational cohort study included 2234 patients with MICU stays in 2018. An automated extraction process using ICD-10 codes, validated by a 196-patient manual chart review, was used for data collection. Demographics, medications, and risk factors were collected. Multiple risk scores were calculated for each patient, and AF recurrence was also manually extracted. Length of stay, mortality, and new stroke were primary recorded outcomes. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty one patients of the 2234 patient cohort (11.4%) developed NOAF during their MICU stay. NOAF was associated with greater length of stay in the MICU (5.84 vs. 3.52 days, p < .001) and in the hospital (15.7 vs. 10.9 days, p < .001). Patients with NOAF had greater odds of hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34-2.71, p < .001) and 1-year mortality (OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.02-1.82, p = .03). CHARGE-AF scores performed best in predicting NOAF (area under the curve (AUC) 0.691, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of NOAF in this MICU cohort was 11.4%, and NOAF was associated with a significant increase in hospital LOS and mortality. Furthermore, the CHARGE-AF score performed best in predicting NOAF.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Diagnostic codes in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) are known to be limited in reporting patient suicidality, and especially in differentiating the levels of suicide severity. OBJECTIVE: The authors developed and validated a portable natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for detection of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide-related behavior and attempts (SB/SA) in EHR data. The algorithm was then deployed, and SI and SB/SA ascertainment was compared to that of International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and 10) diagnostic codes. DESIGN: A group of experts designed the pipeline to detect and distinguish suicide severity based on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Notes were manually annotated to create the "Gold Standard" with which the algorithm output was evaluated for accuracy. SETTING: The algorithm was developed at two academic medical centers, Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS), and tested at these two, plus a third, the University of Utah Healthcare Center (UUHSC). PARTICIPANTS: Notes were from participants with psychiatric encounters at the three institutions. MAIN OUTCOMES: The two main outcomes were the accuracy scores of the NLP pipeline and comparison of ascertainment rates to ICD codes. RESULTS: F1 accuracy scores ranged from 0.86-0.97 at the three sites. The NLP rate of detection of SB/SA was almost 30 times higher, and SI was almost 10 times higher, when compared with that of diagnostic codes. NLP detected almost all cases detected by diagnostic codes. No bias in performance was found for race/ethnicity and performance was comparable in psychiatric and non-psychiatric EHRs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: EHRs from cohorts with psychiatric diagnoses or encounters at WCM, MSHS, and UUHSC had SI and SB/SA extracted using an NLP algorithm based on parameters defined by the C-SSRS. Validity was determined by comparing the algorithm output to manual annotations of clinical notes by domain experts. NLP-detection of SI and SB/SA was compared with that of ICD codes across a range of demographic groups. Algorithm performance was also examined for bias in minoritized groups and in non-psychiatric notes. KEY POINTS:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia during critical illness, representing a sepsis-defining cardiac dysfunction associated with adverse outcomes. Large burdens of premature beats and noisy signal during sepsis may pose unique challenges to automated AF detection. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop and validate an automated algorithm to accurately identify AF within electronic health care data among critically ill patients with sepsis. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with sepsis identified from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) electronic health data with linked electrocardiographic (ECG) telemetry waveforms. Within 3 separate cohorts of 50 patients, we iteratively developed and validated an automated algorithm that identifies ECG signals, removes noise, and identifies irregular rhythm and premature beats in order to identify AF. We compared the automated algorithm to current methods of AF identification in large databases, including ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition) codes and hourly nurse annotation of heart rhythm. Methods of AF identification were tested against gold-standard manual ECG review. RESULTS: AF detection algorithms that did not differentiate AF from premature atrial and ventricular beats performed modestly, with 76% (95% CI 61%-87%) accuracy. Performance improved (P=.02) with the addition of premature beat detection (validation set accuracy: 94% [95% CI 83%-99%]). Median time between automated and manual detection of AF onset was 30 minutes (25th-75th percentile 0-208 minutes). The accuracy of ICD-9 codes (68%; P=.002 vs automated algorithm) and nurse charting (80%; P=.02 vs algorithm) was lower than that of the automated algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: An automated algorithm using telemetry ECG data can feasibly and accurately detect AF among critically ill patients with sepsis, and represents an improvement in AF detection within large databases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the emergency department using an electrocardiogram (ECG) may optimize acute heart failure (AHF) management. We aimed to assess the efficacy of 527 automated 12-lead ECG features for estimating LVEF among patients with AHF. METHOD: Medical records of patients >18 years old and AHF-related ICD codes, demographics, LVEF %, comorbidities, and medication were analyzed. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) identified important ECG features and evaluated performance. RESULTS: Among 851 patients, the mean age was 74 years (IQR:11), male 56% (n=478), and the median body mass index was 29 kg/m CONCLUSIONS: An explainable machine learning model with physiologically feasible predictors may be useful in screening patients with low LVEF in AHF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) remains a safe and effective treatment for severe obesity. The number of robotic SG (RSG) has steadily increased from 2015 to 2021. Prior studies have shown higher rates of some adverse outcomes with RSG but have not accounted for staplers used. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare outcomes for RSG compared to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), accounting for stapler type used. SETTING: National hospital derived administrative data. METHODS: The PINC AI Healthcare Database was used for the current study. Analyzed cohort included elective LSG or RSG performed between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. Patient, hospital, billing, provider, insurance, and operative data were captured. Bleeding, leak, and other outcomes were identified by ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. Propensity score matching (PSM) compared outcomes between RSG with SureForm stapler vs. LSG with powered stapler. RESULTS: 56,013 LSG and 13,832 RSG were analyzed. RSG increased from 15 % in 2019 to 25 % in 2021 with an absolute 27 ​% increase in robotic stapler utilization for RSG. PSM analysis compared, 5434 RSG with SureForm Stapler vs. 5434 LSG with powered staplers showed equivalent complication rates, shorter LOS, but longer operative time with RSG. CONCLUSIONS: When stapler type used is accounted for, patient outcomes following RSG and LSG are equivalent.

AB  - In this retrospective multicentric cohort study, we evaluate the potential benefits of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for the automated detection of Acute kidney injury (AKI). A total of 80,389 cases, hospitalized from 2017 to 2019 at a tertiary care hospital (University of Leipzig Medical Center (ULMC)) and two primary care hospitals (Muldentalkliniken (MTL)) in Germany, were enrolled. AKI was defined and staged according to the Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Clinical and laboratory data was automatically collected from electronic patient records using the frameworks of the CDSS. In our cohort, we found an overall AKI incidence proportion of 12.1%. We identified 6,393/1,703/1,604 cases as AKI stage 1/2/3 (8.0%/2.1%/2.0%, respectively). Administrative coding with N17 (ICD-10-GM) was missing in 55.8% of all AKI cases with the potential for additional diagnosis related groups (DRG) reimbursement of 1,204,200 € in our study. AKI was associated with higher hospital mortality, increased length of hospitalisation and more frequent need of renal replacement therapy. A total of 19.1% of AKI cases (n = 1,848) showed progression to higher AKI stages (progressive AKI) during hospitalization. These cases presented with considerably longer hospitalization, higher rates of renal replacement therapy and increased mortality (p<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, progressive AKI was significantly associated with sepsis, shock, liver cirrhosis, myocardial infarction, and cardiac insufficiency. AKI, and especially its progression during hospitalization, is strongly associated with adverse outcomes. Our automated CDSS enables timely detection and bears potential to improve AKI outcomes, notably in cases of progressive AKI.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study elaborates on previous research to compare length of stay, complication rates, and total cost between patients undergoing robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) and conventional total knee arthroplasty (cTKA). We hypothesized that patients undergoing rTKA would have reduced length of stay, lower complication rates, improved perioperative outcomes, and higher total healthcare costs than those undergoing cTKA. METHODS: Data were collected from the National Inpatient Sample Database Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project between the years 2016-2019. Patients undergoing rTKA and cTKA were identified under International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes (ICD-10-CM/PCS). Length of stay, specific complications, and total costs were examined at time point. SPSS (v 27.0 8, IBM Corp. Armonk, NY) was utilized to compare demographic and analytical statistics between rTKA and cTKA. rTKA and cTKA were compared both before and after propensity matching. RESULTS: 17,249 rTKA (3.09%) and 541,122 cTKA (96.91%) were included. Compared to cTKA patients, rTKA patients had reduced average length of stay of 1.91 days (p < 0.001), higher average total cost of $67133.34 (p < 0.001), reduced periprosthetic infection (OR = 0.027, p < 0.001), periprosthetic dislocation (OR = 0.117, p < 0.001), periprosthetic mechanical complication (OR = 0.315, p < 0.001), pulmonary embolism (OR = 0.358, p < 0.001), transfusion (OR = 0.366, p < 0.001), pneumonia (OR = 0.468, p = 0.002), deep vein thrombosis (OR = 0.479, p = 0.001), and blood loss anemia (OR = 0.728, p < 0.001). These differences remained statistically significant even after propensity matching. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports our hypothesis that rTKA is associated with fewer complications, but higher average total cost than cTKA. Our study shows that rTKA can be safely performed in older and sicker patients. Future studies assessing the impacts of these findings on patient reported outcomes would provide further insight into the benefits of rTKA. Furthermore, identifying patient specific factors that place them at risk for increased complications with cTKA as opposed to rTKA could provide surgeons insight on the method of TKA that maximizes patient outcomes while minimizing healthcare cost.

AB  - Background and objective Accurate identification and categorization of injuries from medical records can be challenging, yet it is important for injury epidemiology and prevention efforts. Coding systems such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) have well-known limitations. Utilizing computer-based techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) can help augment the identification and categorization of diseases in electronic health records. We used a Python program to search the text to identify cases of scooter injuries that presented to our emergency department (ED). Materials and methods This retrospective chart review was conducted between March 2017 and June 2019 in a single, urban academic ED with approximately 80,000 annual visits. The physician documentation was stored as combined PDF files by date. A Python program was developed to search the text from 186,987 encounters to find the string "scoot" and to extract the 100 characters before and after the phrase to facilitate a manual review of this subset of charts. Results A total of 890 charts were identified using the Python program, of which 235 (26.4%) were confirmed as e-scooter cases. Patients had an average age of 36 years and 53% were male. In 81.7% of cases, the patients reported a fall from the scooter and only 1.7% reported wearing a helmet during the event. The most commonly injured body areas were the upper extremity (57.9%), head (42.1%), and lower extremity (36.2%). The most frequently consulted specialists were orthopedic and trauma surgeons with 28% of cases requiring a consult. In our population, 9.4% of patients required admission to the hospital. Conclusions The number of results and data returned by the Python program was easy to manage and made it easier to identify charts for abstraction. The charts obtained allowed us to understand the nature and demographics of e-scooter injuries in our ED. E-scooters continue to be a popular mode of transportation, and understanding injury patterns related to them may inform and guide opportunities for policy and prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPI) is often suboptimal when relying on administrative health data, as International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes are known to have long delays and are undercoded. We leveraged natural language processing (NLP) applications on free-text notes, particularly the inpatient nursing notes, from electronic medical records (EMRs), to more accurately and timely identify HAPIs. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to show that EMR-based phenotyping algorithms are more fitted to detect HAPIs than ICD-10-CA algorithms alone, while the clinical logs are recorded with higher accuracy via NLP using nursing notes. METHODS: Patients with HAPIs were identified from head-to-toe skin assessments in a local tertiary acute care hospital during a clinical trial that took place from 2015 to 2018 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Clinical notes documented during the trial were extracted from the EMR database after the linkage with the discharge abstract database. Different combinations of several types of clinical notes were processed by sequential forward selection during the model development. Text classification algorithms for HAPI detection were developed using random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep learning models. The classification threshold was tuned to enable the model to achieve similar specificity to an ICD-based phenotyping study. Each model's performance was assessed, and comparisons were made between the metrics, including sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F RESULTS: Data from 280 eligible patients were used in this study, among whom 97 patients had HAPIs during the trial. RF was the optimal performing model with a sensitivity of 0.464 (95% CI 0.365-0.563), specificity of 0.984 (95% CI 0.965-1.000), and F CONCLUSIONS: The EMR-based NLP phenotyping algorithms demonstrated improved performance in HAPI case detection over ICD-10-CA codes alone. Daily generated nursing notes in EMRs are a valuable data resource for ML models to accurately detect adverse events. The study contributes to enhancing automated health care quality and safety surveillance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare comorbidities and biologic DMARD (bDMARD) use between AS and non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA) patients, using a large cohort of patients from routine clinical practice in the United States. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using electronic medical records from two academic hospitals in the United States. Data were extracted using automated searches (⩾3 ICD codes combined with text searches) and supplemented with manual chart review. Patients were categorized into AS or nr-axSpA according to classification criteria. Disease features, comorbidities (from a list of 39 chronic conditions) and history of bDMARD prescription were compared using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Among 965 patients identified, 775 (80%) were classified as having axSpA. The cohort was predominantly male (74%) with a mean age of 52.5 years (s.d. 16.8). AS patients were significantly older (54 vs 46 years), more frequently male (77% vs 64%) and had higher serum inflammatory markers than those with nr-axSpA (median CRP 3.4 vs 2.2 mg/dl). Half of all patients had at least one comorbidity. The mean number of comorbidities was 1.5 (s.d. 2.2) and similar between AS and nr-axSpA groups. A history of bDMARD-use was seen in 55% of patients with no difference between groups. The most commonly prescribed bDMARDs were adalimumab (31%) and etanercept (29%). Ever-prescriptions of individual bDMARDs were similar between AS and nr-axSpA. CONCLUSION: Despite age differences, nr-axSpA patients had similar comorbidity burdens as those with AS. Both groups received comparable bDMARD treatment in this United States clinic-based cohort.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Machine learning has been used extensively in clinical text classification tasks. Deep learning approaches using word embeddings have been recently gaining momentum in biomedical applications. In an effort to automate the identification of altered mental status (AMS) in emergency department provider notes for the purpose of decision support, we compare the performance of classic bag-of-words-based machine learning classifiers and novel deep learning approaches. METHODS: We used a case-control study design to extract an adequate number of clinical notes with AMS and non-AMS based on ICD codes. The notes were parsed to extract the history of present illness, which was used as the clinical text for the classifiers. The notes were manually labeled by clinicians. As a baseline for comparison, we tested several traditional bag-of-words based classifiers. We then tested several deep learning models using a convolutional neural network architecture with three different types of word embeddings, a pre-trained word2vec model and two models without pre-training but with different word embedding dimensions. RESULTS: We evaluated the models on 1130 labeled notes from the emergency department. The deep learning models had the best overall performance with an area under the ROC curve of 98.5% and an accuracy of 94.5%. Pre-training word embeddings on the unlabeled corpus reduced training iterations and had performance that was statistically no different than the other deep learning models. CONCLUSION: This supervised deep learning approach performs exceedingly well for the detection of AMS symptoms in clinical text in our environment. Further work is needed for the generalizability of these findings, including evaluation of these models in other types of clinical notes and other environments. The results seem promising for the ultimate use of these types of classifiers in combination with other information derived from the electronic health records as input for clinical decision support.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to adapt our radiology reports to provide the documentation required for specific International Classification of Diseases, tenth rev (ICD-10) diagnosis coding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline data were analyzed to identify the reports with the greatest number of unspecified ICD-10 codes assigned by computer-assisted coding software. A two-part quality improvement initiative was subsequently implemented. The first component involved improving clinical histories by utilizing technologists to obtain information directly from the patients or caregivers, which was then imported into the radiologist's report within the speech recognition software. The second component involved standardization of report terminology and creation of four different structured report templates to determine which yielded the fewest reports with an unspecified ICD-10 code assigned by an automated coding engine. RESULTS: In all, 12,077 reports were included in the baseline analysis. Of these, 5,151 (43%) had an unspecified ICD-10 code. The majority of deficient reports were for radiographs (n = 3,197; 62%). Inadequacies included insufficient clinical history provided and lack of detailed fracture descriptions. Therefore, the focus was standardizing terminology and testing different structured reports for radiographs obtained for fractures. At baseline, 58% of radiography reports contained a complete clinical history with improvement to >95% 8 months later. The total number of reports that contained an unspecified ICD-10 code improved from 43% at baseline to 27% at completion of this study (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: The number of radiology studies with a specific ICD-10 code can be improved through quality improvement methodology, specifically through the use of technologist-acquired clinical histories and structured reporting.

AB  - Investigations generally assess 30 days of perioperative outcomes with robotic-assisted and laparoscopic colectomy. Outcomes beyond 30 days serve as a quality metric of surgical services and an assessment of 90 days of outcomes may have greater clinical utility. The purpose of this study was to assess 90 days of outcomes, length of stay (LOS), and readmissions among patients who underwent a robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic colectomy using a national database. Patients undergoing either robotic-assisted or laparoscopic colectomy were identified using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes within PearlDiver, a national, inpatient records database from 2010 to 2019. Outcomes were defined using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) risk calculator and identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD) diagnosis codes. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests, and continuous variables were compared using paired t tests. Covariate-adjusted regression models were also constructed to evaluate these associations while accounting for potential confounders. A total of 82,495 patients were assessed in this study. At 90 days, patients of the laparoscopic colectomy cohort experienced a higher rate of complications than patients who underwent robotic-assisted colectomy (9.5 vs. 6.6%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in LOS (6 vs. 6.5 days, p = 0.08) and readmissions (6.1 vs. 6.7%, p = 0.851) at 90 days. Patients undergoing robotic-assisted colectomy have a lower risk for morbidity at 90 days. Neither approach is superior for LOS nor 90 days of readmissions. Both techniques are effective minimally invasive procedures, yet patients may gain a greater risk benefit from robotic colectomy.

AB  - Tracking population-level cancer information is essential for researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and the public. Unfortunately, much of the information is stored as unstructured data in pathology reports. Thus, too process the information, we require either automated extraction techniques or manual curation. Moreover, many of the cancer-related concepts appear infrequently in real-world training datasets. Automated extraction is difficult because of the limited data. This study introduces a novel technique that incorporates structured expert knowledge to improve histology and topography code classification models. Using pathology reports collected from the Kentucky Cancer Registry, we introduce a novel multi-task training approach with hierarchical regularization that incorporates structured information about the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition classes to improve predictive performance. Overall, we find that our method improves both micro and macro F1. For macro F1, we achieve up to a 6% absolute improvement for topography codes and up to 4% absolute improvement for histology codes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many patients who are discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a symptom-based discharge diagnosis (SBD) have post-discharge challenges related to lack of a definitive discharge diagnosis and follow-up plan. There is no well-defined method for identifying patients with a SBD without individual chart review. We describe a method for automated identification of SBDs from ICD-10 codes using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. METHODS: We mapped discharge diagnosis, with use of ICD-10 codes from a one-month period of ED discharges at an urban, academic ED to UMLS concepts and semantic types. Two physician reviewers independently manually identified all discharge diagnoses consistent with SBDs. We calculated inter-rater reliability for manual review and the sensitivity and specificity for our automated process for identifying SBDs against this "gold standard." RESULTS: We identified 3642 ED discharges with 1382 unique discharge diagnoses that corresponded to 875 unique ICD-10 codes and 10 UMLS semantic types. Over one third (37.5%, n = 1367) of ED discharges were assigned codes that mapped to the "Sign or Symptom" semantic type. Inter-rater reliability for manual review of SBDs was very good (0.87). Sensitivity and specificity of our automated process for identifying encounters with SBDs were 84.7% and 96.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Use of our automated process to identify ICD-10 codes that classify into the UMLS "Sign or Symptom" semantic type identified the majority of patients with a SBD. While this method needs refinement to increase sensitivity of capture, it has potential to automate an otherwise highly time-consuming process. This novel use of informatics methods can facilitate future research specific to patients with SBDs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of automated diagnoses extracted from medical care databases by the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) study. METHODS: Two methods are used to assess quality of VSD diagnosis data. The first method compares common automated and abstracted diagnostic categories ("outcomes") in 1-2% simple random samples of study populations. The second method estimates positive predictive values of automated diagnosis codes used to identify potential cases of rare conditions (e.g., acute ataxia) for inclusion in nested case-control medical record abstraction studies. RESULTS: There was good agreement (64-68%) between automated and abstracted outcomes in the 1-2% simple random samples at 3 of the 4 VSD sites and poor agreement (44%) at 1 site. Overall at 3 sites, 56% of children with automated cerebella ataxia codes (ICD-9 = 334) and 22% with "lack of coordination" codes (ICD-9 = 781.3) met objective clinical criteria for acute ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: The misclassification error rates for automated screening outcomes substantially reduce the power of screening analyses and limit usefulness of screening analyses to moderate to strong vaccine-outcome associations. Medical record verification of outcomes is needed for definitive assessments.

AB  - PURPOSE: Many publications have focused on single-surgeon or single-center data, comparing surgical approach in inguinal hernia repair. This study evaluated outcomes in patients who underwent open (OIHR), laparoscopic (LIHR) or robotic (RIHR) inguinal hernia repair using a national database. METHODS: The Vizient clinical database was queried using ICD-9 and ICD-10 procedure and diagnosis codes for RIHR, LIHR, and OIHR from 2013 to 2017. Elective procedures classified as minor or moderate risk severity were included. Complications, 30-day readmission, mortality, LOS, and intra-hospital opiate utilization were analyzed using IBM SPSS v.23.0. RESULTS: 3547 patients (OIHR: N = 2413, LIHR: N = 540, RIHR: N = 594) were included in the study. Majority were male (OIHR 84.1%, LIHR 80.4%, RIHR 95.3%), ≥ 51 years (OIHR 81.5%, LIHR 81.7%, RIHR 95.3%), and Caucasian (OIHR 75.7%, LIHR 77.0%, RIHR 81.5%). RIHR had the least overall complications (0.67%) compared to LIHR (4.44%) and OIHR (3.85%), p < 0.05. OIHR had the highest postoperative infection rate (8.33%), versus LIHR (0.56%) and RIHR (0.0%), p < 0.05. OIHR had longer length of stay (3.57 ± 4.1 days) when compared to both groups (LIHR 2.2 ± 2.13 days, RIHR 1.75 ± 1.62 days), p < 0.001. OIHR had higher 30-day readmission rates (3.61%) compared to RIHR (0.84%), p = 0.001. Mortality was similar between groups (OIHR 0.21%, LIHR 0.19%, RIHR 0.17%), p = 0.081. Opiate use was higher with OIHR (96.0%), compared to both LIHR (93.1%), and RIHR (93.8%), p = 0.004. CONCLUSION: RIHR outcomes were improved compared to OIHR or LIHR. OIHR had the highest rate of opiate use, there was no difference between LIHR and RIHR. Further studies are needed to determine the role of RIHR and to assess whether surgeon or patient selection contributes to outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Co-management between internists and surgeons of selected patients is becoming one of the pillars of modern clinical management in large hospitals. Defining the patients to be co-managed is essential. The aim of this study is to create a decision tool using real-world patient data collected in the preoperative period, to support the decision on which patients should have the co-management service offered. METHODS: Data was collected from the electronic clinical health records of patients who had an International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9) code of colorectal surgery during the period between January 2012 and October 2014 in a 200 bed private teaching hospital in Lisbon. ICD-9 codes of colorectal surgery [48.5 and 48.6 (anterior rectal resection and abdominoperineal resection), 45.7 (partial colectomy), 45.8 (Total Colectomy), and 45.9 (Bowel Anastomosis)] were used. Only patients above 18 years old were considered. Patients with more than one procedure were excluded from the study. From these data the authors investigated the construction of predictive models using logistic regression and Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy modelling. RESULTS: Data contains information obtained from the clinical records of a cohort of 344 adult patients. Data from 398 emergent and elective surgeries were collected, from which 54 were excluded because they were second procedures for the same patients. Four preoperative variables were identified as being the most predictive of co-management, in multivariable regression analysis. The final model performed well after being internally validated (0.81 AUC, 77% accuracy, 74% sensitivity, 78% specificity, 93% negative predictive value). The results indicate that the decision process can be more objective and potentially automated. CONCLUSIONS: The authors developed a prediction model based on preoperative characteristics, in order to support the decision for the co-management of surgical patients in the postoperative ward setting. The model is a simple bedside decision tool that uses only four numerical variables.

AB  - A chemical isotope labeling or isotope coded derivatization (ICD) metabolomics platform uses a chemical derivatization method to introduce a mass tag to all of the metabolites having a common functional group (e.g., amine), followed by LC-MS analysis of the labeled metabolites. To apply this platform to metabolomics studies involving quantitative analysis of different groups of samples, automated data processing is required. Herein, we report a data processing method based on the use of a mass spectral feature unique to the chemical labeling approach, i.e., any differential-isotope-labeled metabolites are detected as peak pairs with a fixed mass difference in a mass spectrum. A software tool, IsoMS, has been developed to process the raw data generated from one or multiple LC-MS runs by peak picking, peak pairing, peak-pair filtering, and peak-pair intensity ratio calculation. The same peak pairs detected from multiple samples are then aligned to produce a CSV file that contains the metabolite information and peak ratios relative to a control (e.g., a pooled sample). This file can be readily exported for further data and statistical analysis, which is illustrated in an example of comparing the metabolomes of human urine samples collected before and after drinking coffee. To demonstrate that this method is reliable for data processing, five (13)C2-/(12)C2-dansyl labeled metabolite standards were analyzed by LC-MS. IsoMS was able to detect these metabolites correctly. In addition, in the analysis of a (13)C2-/(12)C2-dansyl labeled human urine, IsoMS detected 2044 peak pairs, and manual inspection of these peak pairs found 90 false peak pairs, representing a false positive rate of 4.4%. IsoMS for Windows running R is freely available for noncommercial use from www.mycompoundid.org/IsoMS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleeve gastrectomy has become a gold standard in addressing medically refractory obesity. Robotic platforms are becoming more utilized, however, data on its cost-effectiveness compared to laparoscopy remain controversial (1-3). At NYU Langone Health, many of the bariatric surgeons adopted robotic surgery as part of their practices starting in 2021. We present a retrospective cost analysis of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) vs. robotic sleeve gastrectomy (RSG) at New York University (NYU) Langone Health campuses. METHODS: All adult patients ages 18-65 who underwent LSG or RSG from 202 to 2023 at NYU Langone Health campuses (Manhattan, Long Island, and Brooklyn) were evaluated via electronic medical records and MBSAQIP 30-day follow-up data. Patients with prior bariatric surgery were excluded. Complication-related ICD-10/CPT codes are collected and readmission costs will be estimated from ICD codes using the lower limit of CMS transparent NYU standard charges (3). Direct charge data for surgery and length of stay cost data were also obtained. Statistical T-test and chi-squared analysis were used to compare groups. RESULTS: Direct operating cost data at NYU Health Campuses demonstrated RSG was associated with 4% higher total charges, due to higher OR charges, robotic-specific supplies, and more post-op ED visits. CONCLUSIONS: RSG was associated with higher overall hospital charges compared to LSG, though there are multiple contributing factors. More research is needed to identify cost saving measures. This study is retrospective in nature, and does not include indirect costs nor reimbursement. Direct operating costs, per contractual agreement with suppliers, are only given as percentages. Data are limited to 30-day follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The modified frailty index (mFI-5) is a National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-derived 5-factor index that has been proven to reflect frailty and predict morbidity and mortality. We hypothesize that mFI-5 is a valid predictive measure in the transoral robotic surgery (TORS) population. METHODS: Retrospective study utilizing the TriNetX US-collaborative health records network querying for TORS patients. Cohorts were stratified by mFI-5 score which uses five ICD-10 codes: nonindependent functional status, hypertension, obstructive respiratory disease, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Cohorts were matched by age using propensity score matching. Outcome measures included survival, infection, pneumonia, tracheostomy dependence, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy dependence. Reported odds ratios were normalized to mFI-5 = 0. RESULTS: A total of 9,081 patients were included in the final analysis. Greater mFI-5 scores predicted decreased survival and increased incidence of postoperative infection and pneumonia. Odds of 5-year mortality were 1.93 (p = 0.0003) for mFI-5 = 2 and 1.90 (p = 0.0002) for mFI-5 = 3. Odds of 2-year mortality were 1.25 (p = 0.0125) for mFI-5 = 1, 1.58 (p = 0.0002) for mFI-5 = 2, and 1.87 (p = 0.003) for mFI-5 = 3. Odds of postoperative infection were 1.51 (p = 0.02) for mFI-5 = 2 and 1.78 (p = 0.05) for mFI-5 = 3. Two-year odds of developing pneumonia were 1.69 (p = 0.0001) for mFI-5 = 2 and 2.84 (p < 0.0001) for mFI-5 = 3. Two-month odds of pneumonia were 1.50 (p = 0.0259) for mFI-5 = 2 and 2.55 (p = 0.0037) for mFI-5 = 3. mFI-5 = 4 or 5 had too few patients to analyze. Using polynomial regression to model age versus incident 5-year post-TORS death (R CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that mFI-5 predicts mortality, pneumonia, and postoperative infection independently of age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Asbest chrysotile cohort was set up in Asbest town, Sverdlovsk oblast, Russian Federation, among the current and former workforce of the world's largest operating chrysotile mine and its processing mills, to investigate cancer risk in relation to occupational exposure to chrysotile. OBJECTIVES: The cohort of 35,837 people was followed-up for mortality using cause-of-death information from official death certificates issued by the Civil Act Registration Office (ZAGS) of Sverdlovsk oblast from 1976 to 2015. Data were also retrieved from the electronic cause-of-death registry of the Medical Information Analytical Centre (MIAC) of Sverdlovsk oblast, which was launched in 1990 and operates independently of ZAGS. The objectives were to compare the completeness of record linkage (RL) with ZAGS and with MIAC, and to compare the agreement of cause-of-death information obtained from ZAGS and from MIAC, with a focus on malignant neoplasms. METHODS: RL completeness of identifying cohort members in ZAGS and in MIAC was compared for the period 1990 to 2015. In the next step, for the comparison of the retrieved cause-of-death information, 5,463 deaths (1,009 from cancer) were used that were registered in 2002 to 2015, when causes of death were coded using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) nomenclature by MIAC. For ZAGS, original cause-of-death text from the death certificates was obtained and then coded according to ICD-10 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer/World Health Organization (IARC/WHO). Agreement was evaluated at various levels of detail, and reasons for any disagreements between the MIAC and the IARC/WHO ICD-10-coded cancer diagnosis were systematically explored. RESULTS: A total of 10,886 deaths were obtained from all avenues of follow-up for the period 1990 to 2015 in the cohort; 10,816 (99.4%) of these were found in ZAGS. This percentage was 88.3% if only automated deterministic RL was used and 99.4% when deterministic RL was complemented with manual searches of cohort members. Comparison of the cause-of-death information showed agreement of 97.9% at the ICD-10 main group level between ZAGS (coded by IARC/WHO) and MIAC. Of 1,009 cancer deaths, 679 (67.3%) cases had identical coding, 258 (25.6%) cases corresponded at the three-character ICD-10 level, 36 (3.6%) had codes that were within the same anatomical or morphological cluster, and for only 36 (3.6%) cases were major discrepancies identified. Altogether, the agreement between IARC/WHO coding of cause-of-death information from ZAGS and MIAC coding of malignant neoplasms was therefore 96.4%. CONCLUSIONS: RL completeness and agreement of cause-of-death information obtained from ZAGS and from MIAC were both very high. This is reassuring for the quality of cancer mortality follow-up of the Asbest chrysotile cohort. For future epidemiological studies in the Russian Federation, ZAGS appears to be a reliable information source for mortality follow-up, if the automated RL is complemented with manual searches of cohort members. MIAC is a good resource for prospective studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This work deals with clinical text mining, a field of Natural Language Processing applied to biomedical informatics. The aim is to classify Electronic Health Records with respect to the International Classification of Diseases, which is the foundation for the identification of international health statistics, and the standard for reporting diseases and health conditions. Within the framework of data mining, the goal is the multi-label classification, as each health record has assigned multiple International Classification of Diseases codes. We investigate five Deep Learning architectures with a dataset obtained from the Basque Country Health System, and six different perspectives derived from shifts in the input and the output. METHODS: We evaluate a Feed Forward Neural Network as the baseline and several Recurrent models based on the Bidirectional GRU architecture, putting our research focus on the text representation layer and testing three variants, from standard word embeddings to meta word embeddings techniques and contextual embeddings. RESULTS: The results showed that the recurrent models overcome the non-recurrent model. The meta word embeddings techniques are capable of beating the standard word embeddings, but the contextual embeddings exhibit as the most robust for the downstream task overall. Additionally, the label-granularity alone has an impact on the classification performance. CONCLUSIONS: The contributions of this work are a) a comparison among five classification approaches based on Deep Learning on a Spanish dataset to cope with the multi-label health text classification problem; b) the study of the impact of document length and label-set size and granularity in the multi-label context; and c) the study of measures to mitigate multi-label text classification problems related to label-set size and sparseness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying patients with certain clinical criteria based on manual chart review of doctors' notes is a daunting task given the massive amounts of text notes in the electronic health records (EHR). This task can be automated using text classifiers based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques along with pattern recognition machine learning (ML) algorithms. The aim of this research is to evaluate the performance of traditional classifiers for identifying patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in comparison with a newer Bayesian word vector method. METHODS: We obtained clinical notes for patients with SLE diagnosis along with controls from the Rheumatology Clinic (662 total patients). Sparse bag-of-words (BOWs) and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) matrices were produced using NLP pipelines. These matrices were subjected to several different NLP classifiers: neural networks, random forests, naïve Bayes, support vector machines, and Word2Vec inversion, a Bayesian inversion method. Performance was measured by calculating accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of a cross-validated (CV) set and a separate testing set. RESULTS: We calculated the accuracy of the ICD-9 billing codes as a baseline to be 90.00% with an AUC of 0.900, the shallow neural network with CUIs to be 92.10% with an AUC of 0.970, the random forest with BOWs to be 95.25% with an AUC of 0.994, the random forest with CUIs to be 95.00% with an AUC of 0.979, and the Word2Vec inversion to be 90.03% with an AUC of 0.905. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a shallow neural network with CUIs and random forests with both CUIs and BOWs are the best classifiers for this lupus phenotyping task. The Word2Vec inversion method failed to significantly beat the ICD-9 code classification, but yielded promising results. This method does not require explicit features and is more adaptable to non-binary classification tasks. The Word2Vec inversion is hypothesized to become more powerful with access to more data. Therefore, currently, the shallow neural networks and random forests are the desirable classifiers.

AB  - Background.  The optimum approach for infectious complication surveillance for cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) procedures is unclear. We created an automated surveillance tool for infectious complications after CIED procedures. Methods.  Adults having CIED procedures between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2011 at Duke University Hospital were identified retrospectively using International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9) procedure codes. Potential infections were identified with combinations of ICD-9 diagnosis codes and microbiology data for 365 days postprocedure. All microbiology-identified and a subset of ICD-9 code-identified possible cases, as well as a subset of procedures without microbiology or ICD-9 codes, were reviewed. Test performance characteristics for specific queries were calculated. Results.  Overall, 6097 patients had 7137 procedures. Of these, 1686 procedures with potential infectious complications were identified: 174 by both ICD-9 code and microbiology, 14 only by microbiology, and 1498 only by ICD-9 criteria. We reviewed 558 potential cases, including all 188 microbiology-identified cases, 250 randomly selected ICD-9 cases, and 120 with neither. Overall, 65 unique infections were identified, including 5 of 250 reviewed cases identified only by ICD-9 codes. Queries that included microbiology data and ICD-9 code 996.61 had good overall test performance, with sensitivities of approximately 90% and specificities of approximately 80%. Queries with ICD-9 codes alone had poor specificity. Extrapolation of reviewed infectious rates to nonreviewed cases yields an estimated rate of infection of 1.3%. Conclusions.  Electronic queries with combinations of ICD-9 codes and microbiologic data can be created and have good test performance characteristics for identifying likely infectious complications of CIED procedures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Conducting manual surveillance of non-ventilator-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia (nvHAP) using ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) surveillance criteria is very resource intensive. We developed and validated a semi-automated surveillance system for nvHAP, and describe nvHAP incidence and aetiology at our hospital. METHODS: We applied an automated classification algorithm mirroring ECDC definition criteria to distinguish patients 'not at risk' from patients 'at risk' for suffering from nvHAP. 'At risk'-patients were manually screened for nvHAP. For validation, we applied the reference standard of full manual evaluation to three validation samples comprising 2091 patients. RESULTS: Among the 39 519 University Hospital Zurich inpatient discharges in 2017, the algorithm identified 2454 'at-risk' patients, reducing the number of medical records to be manually screened by 93.8%. From this subset, nvHAP was identified in 251 patients (0.64%, 95%CI: 0.57-0.73). Sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy of semi-automated surveillance versus full manual surveillance were lowest in the validation sample consisting of patients with HAP according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) discharge diagnostic codes, with 97.5% (CI: 93.7-99.3%), 99.2% (CI: 97.9-99.8%), and 99.4% (CI: 98.4-99.8%), respectively. The overall incidence rate of nvHAP was 0.83/1000 patient days (95%CI: 0.73-0.94), with highest rates in haematology/oncology, cardiac and thoracic surgery, and internal medicine including subspecialties. CONCLUSIONS: The semi-automated surveillance demonstrated a very high sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy. This approach significantly reduces manual surveillance workload, thus making continuous nvHAP surveillance feasible as a pivotal element for successful prevention efforts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Listing tools have been developed to improve medications in older patients, including the Fit fOR The Aged (FORTA) list, a clinically validated, positive-negative list of medication appropriateness. Here, we aim to validate MyFORTA, an automated tool for individualized application of the FORTA list. METHODS: 331 participants of a multi-center cohort study (AgeCoDe) for whom the FORTA score (sum of overtreatment and undertreatment errors) had been determined manually (gold standard [GS]) were reassessed using the automated MyFORTA (MF) tool. This tool determines the score from ATC and ICD codes combined with clinical parameters. RESULTS: The FORTA scores were 9.01 ± 2.91 (mean ± SD, MF) versus 6.02 ± 2.52 (GS) (p < 0.00001). Removing undertreatment errors for calcium/vitamin D (controversial guidelines) and influenza/pneumococcal vaccinations (no robust information in the database), the difference decreased: 7.5 ± 2.7 (MF) versus 5.98 ± 2.55 (GS) (p < 0.00001). The remaining difference was driven by, for example, missing nitro spray in coronary heart disease/acute coronary syndrome as the related information was rarely found in the database, but notoriously detected by MF. Three hundred and forty errors from those 100 patients with the largest score deviation accounted for 68% of excess errors by MF. CONCLUSION: MF was more sensitive to detect medication errors than GS, all frequent errors only detected by MF were plausible, and almost no adaptations of the MF algorithm seem indicated. This automated tool to check medication appropriateness according to the FORTA list is now validated and represents the first clinically directed algorithm in this context. It should ease the application of FORTA and help to implement the proven beneficial effects of FORTA on clinical endpoints.

AB  - With the spread of avian influenza, use of automated data streams to rapidly detect and track human influenza cases has increased. We performed correlation analyses to determine whether International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), groupings used to detect influenzalike illness (ILI) within an automated syndromic system correlate with respiratory virus laboratory test results in the same population (r = 0.71 or 0.86, depending on group). We used temporal and signal-to-noise analysis to identify 2 subsets of ICD-9 codes that most accurately represent ILL trends, compared nationwide sentinel ILL surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the automated data (r = 0.97), and found the most sensitive set of ICD-9 codes for respiratory illness surveillance. Our results demonstrate a method for selecting the best group of ICD-9 codes to assist system developers and health officials who are interpreting similar data for daily public health activities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative evaluation of bleeding and thromboembolic risks in patients receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy remains a clinical challenge. Decisions regarding drug discontinuation, withdrawal timing, and resumption must carefully balance the risks of hemorrhage and thromboembolism. We developed an innovative, integrated intelligent evaluation system to assist clinicians in minimizing intraoperative bleeding, postoperative ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and diabetic ketoacidosis. METHODS: The system's functionality was enhanced through the following: 1. Integration with hospital information systems and national cloud-based medical record retrieval for currently used medications. 2. Identification of high-risk thromboembolism patients using ICD-10 coding. 3. Bleeding risk assessment based on the 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guidelines. 4. Automated anticoagulant discontinuation recommendations by evaluating bleeding and embolic risks. 5. Calculation of optimal withdrawal timing using patients' creatinine clearance and body weight. 6. Automated prompts for appropriate therapy resumption. RESULTS: Between January 2018 and September 2021, five patients experienced postoperative ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction within 14 days postoperatively. Following the implementation of the intelligent evaluation system in October 2021, no such adverse events were reported through March 2025. Additionally, the combined time spent on evaluation and instruction was reduced by 3.16 min compared with the previous process. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-disciplinary decision-support platform enhances perioperative safety through comprehensive drug data retrieval and real-time pharmacological calculations for patients receiving anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and SGLT2 inhibitors. By offering structured, automated guidance on drug management, the system fosters consensus among physicians, surgeons, and pharmacists while aligning with clinical workflow needs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer screening and treatment data are often limited to restricted populations, including women older than 65 years old. The goal of this project was to develop procedures to link tumor registry and insurance claims databases on women younger than 65 years old with breast cancer and to assess the accuracy and validity of the linked dataset. METHODS: Iowa Cancer Registry (ICR) and Wellmark Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Iowa (BC/BS) membership files of women with incident in situ or invasive breast cancer from 1989 to 1996 were linked. An automated deterministic match was followed with visual inspection from three independent reviewers applying a matching protocol. Matched and overall registry data were compared to assess population representativeness. Claims from BC/BS for incident cases during 1994 were examined for coding of a recent breast cancer diagnosis or treatment. RESULTS: The final dataset included 4,397 matched cases of patients aged 21 years and older from 1989 to 1996. The sociodemographic and tumor characteristics of the ICR population younger than 65 years old (n = 7,469) with breast cancer or carcinoma in situ were nearly identical with those of the matched patients younger than 65 years old (n = 3,449). Nearly all (96%) of the 445 matched incident cases in 1994 had claims data (CPT, DRG, or ICD-9 code) indicative of breast cancer. Treatment patterns varied by data source, with agreement ranging from 76% to 82%. CONCLUSIONS: The validity and generalizability of these data demonstrate their potential for further health services research among younger insured women with breast cancer. Additionally, the process outlined may be useful for developing other datasets to study other cancers in the population younger than 65 years old.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cohort selection is challenging for large-scale electronic health record (EHR) analyses, as International Classification of Diseases 9th edition (ICD-9) diagnostic codes are notoriously unreliable disease predictors. Our objective was to develop, evaluate, and validate an automated algorithm for determining an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patient cohort from EHR. We demonstrate its utility via the largest investigation to date of the co-occurrence patterns of medical comorbidities in ASD. METHODS: We extracted ICD-9 codes and concepts derived from the clinical notes. A gold standard patient set was labeled by clinicians at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) (N = 150) and Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center (CCHMC) (N = 152). Two algorithms were created: (1) rule-based implementing the ASD criteria from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Diseases 4th edition, (2) predictive classifier. The positive predictive values (PPV) achieved by these algorithms were compared to an ICD-9 code baseline. We clustered the patients based on grouped ICD-9 codes and evaluated subgroups. RESULTS: The rule-based algorithm produced the best PPV: (a) BCH: 0.885 vs. 0.273 (baseline); (b) CCHMC: 0.840 vs. 0.645 (baseline); (c) combined: 0.864 vs. 0.460 (baseline). A validation at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia yielded 0.848 (PPV). Clustering analyses of comorbidities on the three-site large cohort (N = 20,658 ASD patients) identified psychiatric, developmental, and seizure disorder clusters. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cross-institutional cohort, co-occurrence patterns of comorbidities in ASDs provide further hypothetical evidence for distinct courses in ASD. The proposed automated algorithms for cohort selection open avenues for other large-scale EHR studies and individualized treatment of ASD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMRs) are adopted for storing patient-related healthcare information. Using data mining techniques, it is possible to make use of and derive benefit from this massive amount of data effectively. We aimed to evaluate validity of data extracted by the Customized eXtraction Program (CXP). METHODS: The CXP extracts and structures data in rapid standardised processes. The CXP was programmed to extract TNFα-native active ulcerative colitis (UC) patients from EMRs using defined International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) codes. Extracted data were read in parallel with manual assessment of the EMR to compare with CXP-extracted data. RESULTS: From the complete EMR set, 2,802 patients with code K51 (UC) were extracted. Then, CXP extracted 332 patients according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 97.5% were correctly identified, resulting in a final set of 320 cases eligible for the study. When comparing CXP-extracted data against manually assessed EMRs, the recovery rate was 95.6-101.1% over the years with 96.1% weighted average sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Utilisation of the CXP software can be considered as an effective way to extract relevant EMR data without significant errors. Hence, by extracting from EMRs, CXP accurately identifies patients and has the capacity to facilitate research studies and clinical trials by finding patients with the requested code as well as funnel down itemised individuals according to specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Beyond this, medical procedures and laboratory data can rapidly be retrieved from the EMRs to create tailored databases of extracted material for immediate use in clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coding of obesity using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in healthcare administrative databases is under-reported and thus unreliable for measuring prevalence or incidence. This study aimed to develop and test a rule-based algorithm for automating the detection and severity of obesity using height and weight collected in several sections of the Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 1904 inpatient charts randomly selected in three hospitals in Calgary, Canada between January and June 2015 were reviewed and linked with AllScripts Sunrise Clinical Manager EMRs. A rule-based algorithm was created which looks for patients' height and weight values recorded in EMRs. Clinical notes were split into sentences and searched for height and weight, and BMI was computed. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 1904 patients with 50.8% females and 43.3% > 64 years of age. The final model to identify obesity within EMRs resulted in a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 98.4%, positive predictive value of 96.7%, negative predictive value of 96.6%, and F1 score of 94.8%. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a highly valid rule-based EMR algorithm that detects height and weight. This could allow large-scale analyses using obesity that were previously not possible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) use for ventral hernia repair has increased over the last decade. Whether outcomes are improved by robotic assistance remains a subject of debate. The aim of this study is to evaluate outcomes (including cost, complications, length of stay (LOS), and pain medication utilization) in patients who underwent an open (OVHR), laparoscopic (LVHR), or robotic (RVHR) ventral hernia repair (VHR). METHODS: The Vizient database was queried using ICD-9 procedure and diagnosis codes for patients who underwent VHR from January 2013 to September 2015. Complications, 30-day readmission, mortality, LOS, cost, and intra-hospital opiate utilization were analyzed using IBM SPSS v.23.0.0.0. Median tests with post hoc pairwise comparisons, Fischer's exact, and Pearson's chi-squared test with Bonferroni correction were applied where appropriate, with α = 0.05. RESULTS: 46,799 patients (OVHR: N = 39,505, LVHR: N = 6829, RVHR: N = 465) met the criteria and patients in each group had similar demographics (Table 1). OVHR was associated with significant increased overall complications, 30-day readmission, LOS, and postoperative pain use compared to RVHR or LVHR. OVHR had higher mortality and postoperative infection rates than LVHR. RVHR had significantly higher rates of complications and postoperative infections compared to LVHR, although there was no difference in mortality, 30-day readmission, LOS, and postoperative pain medication use. Mean direct cost of surgery was significantly higher for RVHR, followed by OVHR and LVHR. CONCLUSIONS: Overall patient outcomes were improved in the LVHR and RVHR groups compared to the open approach. However, RVHR patients did not have significant improvement compared with the LVHR group in either short-term outcomes or opiate medication used. While RVHR surgery was the most expensive modality, OVHR was also significantly costlier than LVHR, which was the least expensive. Long-term data on recurrence could not be evaluated and should be studied to determine the role of robotic surgery in VHR and recurrence rates.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is the most frequent hemato-oncological emergency, with high morbidi ty and mortality in pediatrics. The objective of the study was the microbiological characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility of infections associated with FN in pediatric hemato-oncological patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective cohort study with patients aged between 1 month and 18 years, with onco-hematological pathology according to ICD-10 codes, hospitalized in a tertiary healthcare center in Bucaramanga, Colombia. Based on the medical records of the period 2013-2017, the episodes of FN were identified, and the isolated microorganisms and their susceptibility pattern were described. Biochemical identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed with the Dade Behring Microscan« automated system. The resistant microorganism classification was performed based on the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the interpretation of the laboratory according to the cut-off points of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. RESULTS: Of 130 patients, 14.7% of the cultures obtained were positive. Bloods tream infection was observed in 17.5% of the episodes. The isolated microorganisms were mainly Gram-negative bacteria (75.8%). Enterobacteriaceae (EB) were the most frequent, led by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and coagulase-negative Staphylo cocci. Of the EBs, 40.5% showed resistance to Piperacillin/Tazobactam, 33.3% to Cefepime, and 8.2% to Meropenem. According to the antimicrobial resistance pattern, it was observed that 16.4% of the positive EB cultures had an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase pattern and 5% a pattern suggestive of carbapenemases. All Gram-positive cocci were sensitive to Vancomycin. CONCLUSION: In the studied patients, the predominant pathogenic microorganisms were Gram-negative ones with resistance in dices similar to those of developing countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate identification of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cases from automated data is needed for efficient and valid quality improvement initiatives and research. We validated HCC International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes, and evaluated whether natural language processing by the Automated Retrieval Console (ARC) for document classification improves HCC identification. METHODS: We identified a cohort of patients with ICD-9 codes for HCC during 2005-2010 from Veterans Affairs administrative data. Pathology and radiology reports were reviewed to confirm HCC. The positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity of ICD-9 codes were calculated. A split validation study of pathology and radiology reports was performed to develop and validate ARC algorithms. Reports were manually classified as diagnostic of HCC or not. ARC generated document classification algorithms using the Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. ARC performance was compared with manual classification. PPV, sensitivity, and specificity of ARC were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 1138 patients with HCC were identified by ICD-9 codes. On the basis of manual review, 773 had HCC. The HCC ICD-9 code algorithm had a PPV of 0.67, sensitivity of 0.95, and specificity of 0.93. For a random subset of 619 patients, we identified 471 pathology reports for 323 patients and 943 radiology reports for 557 patients. The pathology ARC algorithm had PPV of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.96, and specificity of 0.97. The radiology ARC algorithm had PPV of 0.75, sensitivity of 0.94, and specificity of 0.68. CONCLUSIONS: A combined approach of ICD-9 codes and natural language processing of pathology and radiology reports improves HCC case identification in automated data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The digitisation of healthcare records has generated vast amounts of unstructured data, presenting opportunities for improvements in disease diagnosis when clinical coding falls short, such as in the recording of patient symptoms. This study presents an approach using natural language processing to extract clinical concepts from free-text which are used to automatically form diagnostic criteria for lung cancer from unstructured secondary-care data. METHODS: Patients aged 40 and above who underwent a chest x-ray (CXR) between 2016 and 2022 were included. ICD-10 and unstructured data were pulled from their electronic health records (EHRs) over the preceding 12 months to the CXR. The unstructured data were processed using named entity recognition to extract symptoms, which were mapped to SNOMED-CT codes. Subsumption of features up the SNOMED-CT hierarchy was used to mitigate against sparse features and a frequency-based criteria, combined with univariate logarithmic probabilities, was applied to select candidate features to take forward to the model development phase. A genetic algorithm was employed to identify the most discriminating features to form the diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: 75002 patients were included, with 1012 lung cancer diagnoses made within 12 months of the CXR. The best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.72. Results showed that an existing 'disorder of the lung', such as pneumonia, and a 'cough' increased the probability of a lung cancer diagnosis. 'Anomalies of great vessel', 'disorder of the retroperitoneal compartment' and 'context-dependent findings', such as pain, statistically reduced the risk of lung cancer, making other diagnoses more likely. The performance of the developed model was compared to the existing cancer risk scores, demonstrating superior performance. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methods demonstrated success in leveraging unstructured secondary-care data to derive diagnostic criteria for lung cancer, outperforming existing risk tools. These advancements show potential for enhancing patient care and results. However, it is essential to tackle specific limitations by integrating primary care data to ensure a more thorough and unbiased development of diagnostic criteria. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of contextualising SNOMED-CT concepts into meaningful terminology that resonates with clinicians, facilitating a clearer and more tangible understanding of the criteria applied.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Creation of new algorithms to identify pregnancies in automated health care claims databases is of public health importance, as it allows us to learn more about medication use and safety in a vulnerable population. Previous algorithms were largely created using international classification of disease codes, but despite the U.S. code transition in 2015, few algorithms are available with the latest ICD-10-CM codes. METHODS: Using U.S. IBM MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters and Multi-State Medicaid databases for women aged 10-64 years during 2014 and 2016, two pregnancy algorithms (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) were created using expert clinical review. The algorithms were evaluated by assessing the distribution of pregnancy outcomes (live birth and pregnancy losses) within each time-based cohort and the ability of the algorithms to identify select medication use during pregnancy. Medication exposure, demographics, comorbidities, and pregnancy outcomes were compared to published literature estimates for the two time periods. RESULTS: For the IBM MarketScan® Commercial database, the algorithms identified 687,228 pregnancies in 2014 and 444,293 in 2016. In the IBM MarketScan® Medicaid database, 389,132 pregnancies in 2014 and 406,418 in 2016 were identified. Percentages of most pregnancy outcomes identified using the algorithms were similar to national data sources; however, percentages of preterm births and pregnancy losses were not comparable. Most medication use estimates from the algorithms were similar to or higher than published estimates. CONCLUSIONS: By incorporating the latest ICD-10-CM codes, the new algorithms provide more complete estimates of medication use during pregnancy than algorithms using the outdated codes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Automated disease code classification using free-text medical information is important for public health surveillance. However, traditional natural language processing (NLP) pipelines are limited, so we propose a method combining word embedding with a convolutional neural network (CNN). OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the performance of traditional pipelines (NLP plus supervised machine learning models) with that of word embedding combined with a CNN in conducting a classification task identifying International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes in discharge notes. METHODS: We used 2 classification methods: (1) extracting from discharge notes some features (terms, n-gram phrases, and SNOMED CT categories) that we used to train a set of supervised machine learning models (support vector machine, random forests, and gradient boosting machine), and (2) building a feature matrix, by a pretrained word embedding model, that we used to train a CNN. We used these methods to identify the chapter-level ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes in a set of discharge notes. We conducted the evaluation using 103,390 discharge notes covering patients hospitalized from June 1, 2015 to January 31, 2017 in the Tri-Service General Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. We used the receiver operating characteristic curve as an evaluation measure, and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) and F-measure as the global measure of effectiveness. RESULTS: In 5-fold cross-validation tests, our method had a higher testing accuracy (mean AUC 0.9696; mean F-measure 0.9086) than traditional NLP-based approaches (mean AUC range 0.8183-0.9571; mean F-measure range 0.5050-0.8739). A real-world simulation that split the training sample and the testing sample by date verified this result (mean AUC 0.9645; mean F-measure 0.9003 using the proposed method). Further analysis showed that the convolutional layers of the CNN effectively identified a large number of keywords and automatically extracted enough concepts to predict the diagnosis codes. CONCLUSIONS: Word embedding combined with a CNN showed outstanding performance compared with traditional methods, needing very little data preprocessing. This shows that future studies will not be limited by incomplete dictionaries. A large amount of unstructured information from free-text medical writing will be extracted by automated approaches in the future, and we believe that the health care field is about to enter the age of big data.

AB  - PURPOSE: Limited literature exists substantiating benefits of robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (raTKA) over conventional total knee arthroplasty (cTKA). This study compared postoperative pain, complications, and costs between patients undergoing raTKA and cTKA using large, propensity score-matched cohorts. We hypothesize that the raTKA cohort will be associated with lower pain, lower anemia, and similar cost and other complications. METHODS: A commercially available patient database was used for this study. Patients with raTKA and cTKA were identified with current procedural terminology and international classification of diseases (ICD-9/ICD-10) codes. Exclusions and propensity score matching were applied to mitigate confounding bias. Complication rates, costs, and postoperative opioid uses were then compared between groups. RESULTS: Compared with patients with cTKAs (n = 31,105), patients with raTKAs (n = 6,221) had less postoperative opioid use (p < 0.01), lower rates of postoperative acute renal failure (OR 0.71; p < 0.01), anemia (OR 0.75; p < 0.01), and periprosthetic joint infection (OR 0.59; p = 0.04), and lower index costs ($875 vs. $1,169, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: RaTKA was associated with less postoperative pain and complications compared with cTKA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conversion rates during minimally invasive surgery are generally examined in the limited scope of a particular procedure. However, for a hospital or payor, the cumulative impact of conversions during commonly performed procedures could have a much larger negative effect than what is appreciated by individual surgeons. The aim of this study is to assess open conversion rates during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) across common procedures using laparoscopic/thoracoscopic (LAP/VATS) and robotic-assisted (RAS) approaches. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using the Premier Database on patients who underwent common operations (hysterectomy, lobectomy, right colectomy, benign sigmoidectomy, low anterior resection, inguinal and ventral hernia repair, and partial nephrectomy) between January 2013 and September 2015. ICD-9 and CPT codes were used to define procedures, modality, and conversion. Propensity scores were calculated using patient, hospital, and surgeon characteristics. Propensity-score matched analysis was used to compare conversions between LAP/VATS and RAS for each procedure. RESULTS: A total of 278,520 patients had MIS approaches of the ten operations. Conversion occurred in 5% of patients and was associated with a 1.77 day incremental increase in length of stay and $3441 incremental increase in cost. RAS was associated with a 58.5% lower rate of conversion to open surgery compared to LAP/VATS. CONCLUSION: At a health system or payer level, conversion to open is detrimental not just for the patient and surgeon but also puts a significant strain on hospital resources. Use of RAS was associated with less than half of the conversion rate observed for LAP/VATS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Identify trends of navigation and robotic-assisted elective spine surgeries. METHODS: Elective spine surgery patients between 2007 and 2015 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) were isolated by ICD-9 codes for Navigation [Nav] or Robotic [Rob]-Assisted surgery. Basic demographics and surgical variables were identified via chi-squared and t tests. Each system was analyzed from 2007 to 2015 for trends in usage. RESULTS: Included 3,759,751 patients: 100,488 Nav; 4724 Rob. Nav were younger (56.7 vs 62.7 years), had lower comorbidity index (1.8 vs 6.2, all p < 0.05), more decompressions (79.5 vs 42.6%) and more fusions (60.3 vs 52.6%) than Rob. From 2007 to 2015, incidence of complication increased for Nav (from 5.8 to 21.7%) and Rob (from 3.3 to 18.4%) as well as 2-3 level fusions (from 50.4 to 52.5%) and (from 1.3 to 3.2%); respectively. Invasiveness increased for both (Rob: from 1.7 to 2.2; Nav: from 3.7 to 4.6). Posterior approaches (from 27.4 to 41.3%), osteotomies (from 4 to 7%), and fusions (from 40.9 to 54.2%) increased in Rob. Anterior approach for Rob decreased from 14.9 to 14.4%. Nav increased posterior (from 51.5% to 63.9%) and anterior approaches (from 16.4 to 19.2%) with an increase in osteotomies (from 2.1 to 2.7%) and decreased decompressions (from 73.6 to 63.2%). CONCLUSIONS: From 2007 to 2015, robotic and navigation systems have been performed on increasingly invasive spine procedures. Robotic systems have shifted from anterior to posterior approaches, whereas navigation computer-assisted procedures have decreased in rates of usage for decompression procedures.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHR) provide an unprecedented opportunity to conduct large, cost-efficient, population-based studies. However, the studies of heterogeneous diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), often require labor-intensive clinical review and testing, limiting widespread use of these important resources. To develop a generalizable and efficient method for accurate identification of large COPD cohorts in EHRs, a COPD datamart was developed from 3420 participants meeting inclusion criteria in the Mass General Brigham Biobank. Training and test sets were selected and labeled with gold-standard COPD classifications obtained from chart review by pulmonologists. Multiple classes of algorithms were built utilizing both structured (e.g. ICD codes) and unstructured (e.g. medical notes) data via elastic net regression. Models explicitly including and excluding spirometry features were compared. External validation of the final algorithm was conducted in an independent biobank with a different EHR system. The final COPD classification model demonstrated excellent positive predictive value (PPV; 91.7%), sensitivity (71.7%), and specificity (94.4%). This algorithm performed well not only within the MGBB, but also demonstrated similar or improved classification performance in an independent biobank (PPV 93.5%, sensitivity 61.4%, specificity 90%). Ancillary comparisons showed that the classification model built including a binary feature for FEV1/FVC produced substantially higher sensitivity than those excluding. This study fills a gap in COPD research involving population-based EHRs, providing an important resource for the rapid, automated classification of COPD cases that is both cost-efficient and requires minimal information from unstructured medical records.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the feasibility and performance of a deep learning approach utilizing the Korean Medical BERT (KM-BERT) model for the automated classification of underlying causes of death within national mortality statistics. It aimed to assess predictive accuracy throughout the cause-of-death coding workflow and to identify limitations and opportunities for further artificial intelligence (AI) integration. METHODS: We performed a retrospective prediction study using 693,587 death certificates issued in Korea between January 2021 and December 2022. Free-text fields for immediate, antecedent, and contributory causes were concatenated and fine-tuned with KM-BERT. Three classification models were developed: (1) final underlying cause prediction (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] code) from certificate inputs, (2) tentative underlying cause selection based on ICD-10 Volume 2 rules, and (3) classification of individual cause-of-death entries. Models were trained and validated using 2021 data (80% training, 20% validation) and evaluated on 2022 data. Performance metrics included overall accuracy, weighted F1 score, and macro F1 score. RESULTS: On 306,898 certificates from 2022, the final cause model achieved 62.65% accuracy (F1-weighted, 0.5940; F1-macro, 0.1503). The tentative cause model demonstrated 95.35% accuracy (F1-weighted, 0.9516; F1-macro, 0.4996). The individual entry model yielded 79.51% accuracy (F1-weighted, 0.7741; F1-macro, 0.9250). Error analysis indicated reduced reliability for rare diseases and for specific ICD chapters, which require supplementary administrative data. CONCLUSION: Despite strong performance in mapping free-text inputs and selecting tentative underlying causes, there remains a need for improved data quality, administrative record integration, and model refinement. A systematic, long-term approach is essential for the broad adoption of AI in mortality statistics.

AB  - The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in 2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024. Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10 coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use trends.

AB  - Infectious and inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system are difficult to identify early. Case definitions for aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) are available, but rarely put to use. The VACC-Tool (Vienna Vaccine Safety Initiative Automated Case Classification-Tool) is a mobile application enabling immediate case ascertainment based on consensus criteria at the point-of-care. The VACC-Tool was validated in a quality management program in collaboration with the Robert-Koch-Institute. Results were compared to ICD-10 coding and retrospective analysis of electronic health records using the same case criteria. Of 68,921 patients attending the emergency room in 10/2010-06/2013, 11,575 were hospitalized, with 521 eligible patients (mean age: 7.6 years) entering the quality management program. Using the VACC-Tool at the point-of-care, 180/521 cases were classified successfully and 194/521 ruled out with certainty. Of the 180 confirmed cases, 116 had been missed by ICD-10 coding, 38 misclassified. By retrospective application of the same case criteria, 33 cases were missed. Encephalitis and ADEM cases were most likely missed or misclassified. The VACC-Tool enables physicians to ask the right questions at the right time, thereby classifying cases consistently and accurately, facilitating translational research. Future applications will alert physicians when additional diagnostic procedures are required.

AB  - The objective of this study is to determine recent trends in use of robotics and laparoscopy for pediatric retroperitoneal lymph-node dissection (RPLND) in pediatric and non-pediatric hospitals. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 29 hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), and data from 14 states in the State Inpatient Databases (SID), between 2008 and 2014. The study population was comprised of patients aged ≥ 10 years undergoing RPLND, with an inpatient diagnosis of testicular or paratesticular cancer, based on international classification of disease (ICD) codes. Robotic approach was identified by the presence of an ICD procedure code modifier. During the study period, a total of 90 RPLNDs were performed in pediatric hospitals (median patient age 16 years). Of these, 4 (4.4%) were performed robotically. A total of 3120 RPLNDs were performed in non-pediatric hospitals (median patient age: 32 years). Among these, 269 (8.6%) were performed robotically, with an increasing trend in the use of robotic RPLND (adjusted annual increase in probability of undergoing robotic vs. open procedure: 16%; 95% CI 8-24). Undergoing robotic RPLND was associated with a reduction in postoperative length of stay of 3.5 days (95% CI 2.9, 4.1). Open surgical approaches comprise the vast majority of RPLNDs performed at pediatric hospitals. This is in contrast with trends in non-pediatric hospitals where robotic RPLND is being increasingly utilized. Future research is necessary to investigate this discrepancy in adopting minimally invasive techniques for RPLND in pediatric centers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The International Classification of Disease, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes used for glaucoma severity classification are based on the 24-2 visual-field (VF) test. This study aim was to assess the added value of providing clinicians with optical coherence tomography (OCT) data, in addition to functional data, for glaucoma staging in clinical practice. EXPOSURE: Disease classification was determined for 54 glaucoma eyes, according to the principles of the ICD-10 guidelines. Eyes were independently graded in a masked fashion using the 24-2 VF test and 10-2 VF test, with and without OCT information. The reference standard (RS) for severity was determined using a previously published automated structure-function topographic agreement for glaucomatous damage using all available information. RESULTS: The RS classified eyes as mild, moderate and advanced in 3, 16 and 35 cases, respectively. Individual and combined 24-2 and 10-2 based gradings were significantly different from the RS (all P < 0.005), with Kappa agreements of 0.26, 0.45 and 0.42 respectively (P < 0.001). Classifications using OCT combined with either of the VF were not-significantly different from the RS (P > 0.3) with Kappa agreements of 0.56 and 0.57 respectively (P < 0.001). Combining 24-2 with OCT had less severity overestimations while 10-2 with OCT had fewer underestimations. CONCLUSION: Combining OCT and VF data provides better staging of glaucoma severity than VF data alone. The 24-2 and OCT combination seems most appropriate given the high concordance with the RS and less overestimation of severity. Incorporating structural information into disease stages allows clinicians to set more appropriate severity-based treatment targets for individual patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Variation in outcomes following radical prostatectomy and inclusion of prostate cancer surgery metrics in hospital ratings signal need for procedure-specific quality improvement (QI) efforts. We hypothesized that a novel electronic medical record (EMR)-based, automated algorithm-driven algorithm for surgical outcomes and quality metrics following robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) would demonstrate >90% sensitivity and specificity and significant inter-rater reliability (IRR) with National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) abstraction. STUDY DESIGN: We developed an algorithm to automatically abstract RALP outcomes and quality metrics retrospectively from the EMR. Pathology results were abstracted through text extraction; surgical outcomes were abstracted using ICD-10 codes, CPT codes, and EMR data variables. Sensitivity, specificity, and IRR between the algorithm and NSQIP-abstraction were assessed using Cohen's kappa with statistical significance set P < 0.05. RESULTS: Total of 927 cases were mutually tracked. IRR was highest for mortality (k = 1.00) and lowest for dialysis and ureteral obstruction (k = 0.00). IRR was fair for: sepsis (k = 0.28), renal insufficiency (k = 0.32), and prolonged NGT/NPO (k = 0.39); moderate: UTI (k = 0.50) and stage (k = 0.53); substantial: surgical margins (k = 0.94), urine leak (k = 0.60), C-Diff (k = 0.67), pneumonia (k = 0.80). Sensitivity of the algorithm was > 90% for all mutually tracked outcomes except rectal injury (0%) and specificity was >97%. CONCLUSION: This novel algorithm for RALP outcomes matches or exceeds sensitivity and specificity of institutional NSQIP abstraction for all but 1 variable. Substantial agreement between the algorithm and NSQIP supports automated extraction of outcome metrics as an acceptable replacement for trained abstractors, and broader application provides opportunities to facilitate and reduce cost of outcomes and quality metric benchmarking.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Various attempts at automation have been made to reduce the administrative burden of manually assigning Abbreviated Injury Severity (AIS) codes to derive Injury Severity Scores (ISS) in trauma registry data. The accuracy of the resulting measures remains unclear, especially in the New Zealand (NZ) context. The aim of this study was to compare ISS derived from hospital discharge International Classification of Diseases Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) codes with ISS recorded in the NZ Trauma Registry (NZTR). METHODS: Individuals admitted to hospital and enrolled in the NZTR between 1 December 2016 and 30 November 2018 were included. ISS were calculated using a modified ICD to AIS mapping tool. The agreement between both methods for raw scores was assessed by the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and for categorical scores the Kappa and weighted Kappa index were used. Analysis was conducted by gender, age, ethnicity, and mechanism of injury. RESULTS: 3,156 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The ICC for agreement between the methods was poor (0.40, 95 % CI: 0.37-0.43). The Kappa index indicated slight agreement between both methods when using a cut-off value of 12 (0.06; 95 % CI: 0.01-0.12) and 15 (0.13 6; 95 % CI: 0.09-0.17). CONCLUSION: Although the overall agreement between NZTR-ISS and ICD-ISS was slight, ICD-derived scores may be useful to describe injury patterns and for body region-specific estimations when manually coded ISS are not available.

AB  - Automated coding and classification systems play a role in healthcare for quality of care. Our objective was to predict diagnosis code from medication list of electronic medical record (EMR) using convolutional neural network (CNN). We collected the clinical note from outpatient department (OPD) of Wanfang hospital, Taiwan of 2016 and used three physicians from three departments. The dataset was split into two parts, 90% for training and 10% for test cases. We used medication list as input and International Statistical Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD 10) code as output. After data preprocess, we used word2vector CNN to predict ICD 10 code. This study shows all the three physicians from three departments achieved better performance. The best performance of model was a physician from cardiology department achieved precision 69%, recall 89% and F measure 78%. We need to include more component such as text data, lab report for evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Surgeons have increasingly adopted robotic-assisted lumbar spinal fusion due to indications that robotic-assisted surgery can reduce pedicle screw misplacement. However, the impact of robotic-assisted spinal fusion on patient outcomes is less clear. PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare rates of perioperative complications between robotic-assisted and conventional lumbar spinal fusion. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 520 patients undergoing lumbar fusion were analyzed. The average ages of patients in the robotic-assisted versus conventional groups were 60.33 and 60.31, respectively (p=.987). Patients with a diagnosis of fracture, traumatic spinal cord injury, spina bifida, neoplasia, or infection were excluded. OUTCOME MEASURES: This study compared the rates perioperative major and minor complications for elective lumbar fusion between each cohort. METHODS: This study screened hospital discharges in the United States from 2010 to 2014 using the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes were used to identify 209,073 patients who underwent conventional lumbar fusion (ICD 81.04-8) and 279 patients who underwent robotic-assisted lumbar fusion (ICD 81.04-8 and ICD 17.41, 17.49). Major and minor complications were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. The robotic-assisted and conventional fusion groups were statistically matched on age, year, sex, indication, race, hospital type, and comorbidities. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to compare risks of major and minor complications. RESULTS: We matched 257 (92.11%) robotic-assisted patients with an equal number of patients undergoing conventional lumbar fusion. Minor complications occurred in 16.73% of cases in the conventional group and 31.91% of cases in the robotic-assisted group (p<.001). Major complications occurred in 6.61% of the conventional cases compared to 8.17% of robotic-assisted cases (p=.533). For robotic-assisted fusion, multivariate analysis revealed that there was no difference in the likelihood of major complications (OR=0.834, 95% CI=0.214-3.251) or minor complications (OR = 1.450, 95% CI=0.653-3.220). CONCLUSIONS: In a statistically matched cohort, patients who underwent robotic-assisted lumbar fusion had similar rates of major and minor complications compared to patients who underwent conventional lumbar fusion.

AB  - The object of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9) codes 430-438 in the Sistema Informativo Sanitario Regionale (SISR), an Italian health care automated database. We compared the SISR with a manual search of all cases of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and stroke discharged from the Novara Hospital, NW Italy. Results were as follows: SISR list: 1017 patients; manual list 1005. Linked: 896; false negatives: 109; false positives: 121. Sensitivity of codes 430-438: 77% at the primary position only and 89% at either the primary or secondary position; PPV: 93% and 88%. Sensitivity and PPV for specific codes vs. each subcategory (sensitivity at the primary position only/any position; PPV at the primary position only/any position): for 430, subarachnoid haemorrhage (33/35%; 46/43%); for 431, cerebral haemorrhage (57/59%; 77/75%); for 434, cerebral infarction (35/37%; 90/87%); for 436, stroke of unknown type (29/29%; 19/16%); and for 435, TIA (75/82%; 80/78%). The SISR database has a high PPV; sensitivity is high for TIA, but low for specific stroke ICD codes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine a large cohort of adults who received the zoster vaccine for evidence of an increased risk of prespecified adverse events requiring medical attention. DESIGN: Two self-comparison approaches, including a case-centred approach and a self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis were used. SETTING: Eight managed-care organizations participating in the Vaccine Safety Datalink project in the United States. SUBJECTS: A total of 193 083 adults aged 50 and older receiving a zoster vaccine from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2008 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prespecified adverse events were identified by aggregated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes in automated health plan datasets. RESULTS: The risk of allergic reaction was significantly increased within 1-7 days of vaccination [relative risk = 2.13, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.87-2.40 by case-centred method and relative rate = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.85-2.91 by SCCS]. No increased risk was found for the following adverse event groupings: cerebrovascular events; cardiovascular events; meningitis; encephalitis; and encephalopathy; and Ramsay-Hunt syndrome and Bell's palsy. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the findings from the prelicensure clinical trials, providing reassurance that the zoster vaccine is generally safe and well-tolerated with a small increased risk of allergic reactions in 1-7 days after vaccination.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are little data regarding whether hospital and surgeon factors affect outcomes following robotic-assisted surgery (RAS). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether any such factor was associated with hospital length of stay (HLOS) and complications following common RAS procedures in the State of New York. METHODS: Following IRB approval, The New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System administrative dataset was used to identify eight common RAS procedures through ICD-9 codes: cholecystectomy, colectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, esophageal fundoplication, pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and gastrectomy between 2008 and 2012. Physician factors evaluated included time since graduation, fellowship status, and number of procedures performed; hospital-level factors included urban versus rural setting, teaching status, hospital size, and the presence of a fellowship. All these factors were further evaluated in multivariable regression models to evaluate for effect on overall complication and HLOS after adjusting for covariates such as patients' characteristics and comorbidities. RESULTS: There were 1670 patients who underwent RAS with average HLOS of 4.433 days and overall complication rate of 18.8 %. Univariate analysis showed that patients of physicians having fellowship training tended to have higher rate of complication-22.82 versus 13.49 % (P = 0.0055), but these were also sicker patients. In addition, physicians with higher number of procedures had lower complications (P = 0.0138). However, these two factors were not significant after controlling for other covariates. Neither physician- nor hospital-related factors were significantly related to HLOS with or without adjusting for other covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic assistance may eliminate the differences between hospitals and physicians.

AB  - Crohn's disease is an incurable inflammatory disorder that can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract. While medical management is considered first-line treatment, approximately 70-90% of patients with Crohn's disease will require at least one surgical intervention during the course of their lifetimes. Traditionally, abdominal surgery for Crohn's disease has been performed via an open approach with an increasing adoption of minimally invasive techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare postoperative outcomes from an initial national experience with robotic-assisted ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease. Patients who underwent elective ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease by robotic-assisted or open approaches from 2011 to Q3 2015 were identified using ICD-9 codes from the Premier Healthcare Database. Propensity-score matching (1:1) was performed using age, gender, race, Charlson index score, and year of surgery to form comparable cohorts in order to compare the robotic-assisted and open groups. 3641 patients underwent elective ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease during the study period (1910 [52.5%] open and 109 [3%] robotic-assisted). Post-matched comparison of cohorts (n = 108 per cohort) showed that robotic-assisted cases were longer by a mean of 60 min (p < 0.0001), had shorter length of hospital stay by a median of 2 days (p < 0.001) and a lower 30-day complication rate (24% vs. 38%; p = 0.039). This national database assessment of patients undergoing elective ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease demonstrated that a robotic-assisted approach was associated with longer operative times, shorter length of hospital stay and lower 30-day complication rates compared to open approach.

AB  - STOPP/START v3 is a set of criteria for optimizing therapy for elderly patients with polypharmacy. Implementing these criteria in prescribing software requires to formalize them, which is a difficult task. This project aimed to automate the formalization of these criteria using large language models (LLMs), specifically leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced accuracy. We employed DeepSeek and GPT-4o-mini for entity extraction, code mapping to ICD-10, LOINC, and ATC, and the generation of executable Python code. A preliminary evaluation conducted on a subset of rules yielded a notably high F1-score (0.90, 0.92, 1 for drug, disease and observation entity mapping respectively and perfect results for medical entity extraction and code logic consistency). These results confirm the model's effectiveness in accurately transforming complex clinical rules into executable code. In conclusion, we successfully automated the creation of executable code from medical guidelines, proving that LLMs, supported by RAG, can be effective for automating clinical decision support tasks and formalizing medical rules.

AB  - To explain the variation in total real hospital costs among elderly patients who died between 1984 and 1991, a cohort analytic study of the nationally representative sample of elderly subjects included in the Longitudinal Study on Aging (N = 7,527) was carried out. The cohort comprised the subset of 1,778 community-dwelling Americans who were age 70 years and older in 1984, had one or more subsequent hospital episodes, and died by 1991. Hospital charges for 1984 through 1991 were taken from the Medicare Automated Data Retrieval System. Annual hospital charges were adjusted for inflation (restated in 1984 dollars) using the hospital market basket component of the consumer price index. The natural logarithm of aggregated real charges was used in the analysis. Mean total real hospital charges were $24,956 (SD = $27,847). A standard multivariable regression model explained 9.7% of the variance in real total hospital charges. After incorporating additional measures reflecting a respondent's distribution (mean and standard deviation) of comorbidities (as measured by the number of ICD-9-CM codes [truncated at five]) during all hospitalizations in the observation window, the cause of death, and the concentration of charges in the last year of life, the explained variance increased to 29.3%. The most important explanatory factors were the two variables controlling for the distribution of comorbidity, the variable controlling for population density, and the dichotomous variable indicating that the patient's death was related to an acute myocardial infarction. Total real hospital resources consumed by elderly decedents vary substantially. The concentration of resources consumed in the last year of a respondent's life was only marginally significant in predicting total real hospital charges over an 8-year observation window.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The French National Authority for Health (HAS), with a multidisciplinary working group, developed an indicator 'ISO-ORTHO' to assess surgical site infections (SSIs) after total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA) based on the hospital discharge database. We present the ISO-ORTHO indicator designed for SSI automated detection and its relevance for quality improvement and hospital benchmarks. METHODS: The algorithm is based on a combination of  RESULTS: In total, 790 hospitals and 139,926 THA/TKA stays were assessed; 1,253 SSI were detected in the 473 included hospitals (incidence, 0.9%: 1.0% for THA, 0.80% for TKA). The SSI rate was significantly higher in males (1.2%), in patients with previous osteo-articular infection (4.4%), and those with cancer (2.3%), obesity, or diabetes. Most hospitals (89.9%) were within 2 SD; however, 12 hospitals were classified as outliers at more than +3 SD (1.6% of facilities), and 59 hospitals (7.9%) were outliers between +2 SD and +3 SD. CONCLUSION: ISO-ORTHO is a relevant indicator for automated surveillance; it can provide hospitals a metric for SSI assessment that may contribute to improving patient outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathology laboratories are one of the main information sources for cancer registries and have traditionally been coded with SNOMED; some of them are migrating to SNOMED CT (SCT). Cancer registries encode topography and morphology of neoplasms by the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). ICD-O updates morphology with WHO Classification of Tumors (Blue-Books). Morphological codes of the ICD-O, Blue-Books and SNOMED (former SNOMEDID) have always coincided. In 2017, SCT removed the SNOMEDID. OBJECTIVES: to define neoplastic and topographic subsets in SCT and map them to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books; reduce the original number of SCT concepts; correctly identify neoplasms in the laboratories in accordance with international cancer registry rules. METHODOLOGY: SCT neoplastic concepts were identified by manual revision and SCT resources ("is a", "Associated morphology" relationships; Simple Map Reference Set). Topographic concepts were extracted from the body structure hierarchy of SCT. Both subsets were mapped to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books, afterwards. Updating algorithms were designed to automate and update each subset with every SCT release. The process of neoplasms identification was validated in a sample of 5212 specimens with 7378 records from 8 Catalan hospitals. RESULTS: The number of concepts in neoplastic and topographic subsets (16,448 and 32,278) was reduced after the mapping to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books (2115 and 330, respectively). Neoplastic subset classified the specimens correctly in the 98.6% of the specimens. CONCLUSIONS: This article presents a flexible tool to exhaustively identify neoplasms in pathology laboratories that code with SCT, following international PBCRs standards and in line with the pathologists, oncologists and epidemiologists' needs.

AB  - Many clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are intended to provide evidence-based guidance to clinicians on a single disease, and are frequently considered inadequate when caring for patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC), or two or more chronic conditions. It is unclear to what degree disease-specific CPGs provide guidance about MCC. In this study, we develop a method for extracting knowledge from single-disease chronic condition CPGs to determine how frequently they mention commonly co-occurring chronic diseases. We focus on 15 highly prevalent chronic conditions. We use publicly available resources, including a repository of guideline summaries from the National Guideline Clearinghouse to build a text corpus, a data dictionary of ICD-9 codes from the Medicare Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW) to construct an initial list of disease terms, and disease synonyms from the National Center for Biomedical Ontology to enhance the list of disease terms. First, for each disease guideline, we determined the frequency of comorbid condition mentions (a disease-comorbidity pair) by exactly matching disease synonyms in the text corpus. Then, we developed an annotated reference standard using a sample subset of guidelines. We used this reference standard to evaluate our approach. Then, we compared the co-prevalence of common pairs of chronic conditions from Medicare CCW data to the frequency of disease-comorbidity pairs in CPGs. Our results show that some disease-comorbidity pairs occur more frequently in CPGs than others. Sixty-one (29.0%) of 210 possible disease-comorbidity pairs occurred zero times; for example, no guideline on chronic kidney disease mentioned depression, while heart failure guidelines mentioned ischemic heart disease the most frequently. Our method adequately identifies comorbid chronic conditions in CPG recommendations with precision 0.82, recall 0.75, and F-measure 0.78. Our work identifies knowledge currently embedded in the free text of clinical practice guideline recommendations and provides an initial view of the extent to which CPGs mention common comorbid conditions. Knowledge extracted from CPG text in this way may be useful to inform gaps in guideline recommendations regarding MCC and therefore identify potential opportunities for guideline improvement.

AB  - BackgroundEffective pandemic preparedness requires robust severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance. However, identifying SARI patients based on symptoms is time-consuming. Using the number of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR tests or contact and droplet precaution labels as a proxy for SARI could accurately reflect the epidemiology of patients presenting with SARI.AimWe aimed to compare the number of RT-PCR tests, contact and droplet precaution labels and SARI-related International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 codes and evaluate their use as surveillance indicators.MethodsPatients from all age groups hospitalised at Leiden University Medical Center between 1 January 2017 up to and including 30 April 2023 were eligible for inclusion. We used a clinical data collection tool to extract data from electronic medical records. For each surveillance indicator, we plotted the absolute count for each week, the incidence proportion per week and the correlation between the three surveillance indicators.ResultsWe included 117,404 hospital admissions. The three surveillance indicators generally followed a similar pattern before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The correlation was highest between contact and droplet precaution labels and ICD-10 diagnostic codes (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.84). There was a strong increase in the number of RT-PCR tests after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.DiscussionAll three surveillance indicators have advantages and disadvantages. ICD-10 diagnostic codes are suitable but are subject to reporting delays. Contact and droplet precaution labels are a feasible option for automated SARI surveillance, since these reflect trends in SARI incidence and may be available real-time.

AB  - A correct protocol assignment is critical to high-quality imaging examinations, and its automation can be amenable to natural language processing (NLP). Assigning protocols for abdominal imaging CT scans is particularly challenging given the multiple organ specific indications and parameters. We compared conventional machine learning, deep learning, and automated machine learning builder workflows for this multiclass text classification task. A total of 94,501 CT studies performed over 4 years and their assigned protocols were obtained. Text data associated with each study including the ordering provider generated free text study indication and ICD codes were used for NLP analysis and protocol class prediction. The data was classified into one of 11 abdominal CT protocol classes before and after augmentations used to account for imbalances in the class sample sizes. Four machine learning (ML) algorithms, one deep learning algorithm, and an automated machine learning (AutoML) builder were used for the multilabel classification task: Random Forest (RF), Tree Ensemble (TE), Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), and Google's AutoML builder (Alphabet, Inc., Mountain View, CA), respectively. On the unbalanced dataset, the manually coded algorithms all performed similarly with F1 scores of 0.811 for RF, 0.813 for TE, 0.813 for GBT, 0.828 for MLP, and 0.847 for ULMFiT. The AutoML builder performed better with a F1 score of 0.854. On the balanced dataset, the tree ensemble machine learning algorithm performed the best with an F1 score of 0.803 and a Cohen's kappa of 0.612. AutoML methods took a longer time for completion of NLP model training and evaluation, 4 h and 45 min compared to an average of 51 min for manual methods. Machine learning and natural language processing can be used for the complex multiclass classification task of abdominal imaging CT scan protocol assignment.

AB  - The problem-oriented electronic medical record has been investigated as an alternative to source-oriented organization of patient data. At the core of a problem-oriented view is the medical problem list. Maintenance of the medical problem list is often manual, making it highly user dependent. We detail the beginnings of an automated medical problem list generator based on ICD-9: given a set of ICD-9 codes associated with a patient record, the system maps the codes (and related data) to an anatomy-centric hierarchy. 1 million patient encounters from an outpatient setting were reviewed to generate a unique set of 7,890 ICD-9 codes. Natural language processing of the ICD-9 string descriptions identified 1,981 anatomical terms, which were subsequently mapped to one of 21 anatomical categories. The output of the medical problem list generator was then used to create a problem-oriented, gestalt view of a patient's medical record. Preliminary evaluation of the generator revealed 100% recall, but only 60% precision. This initial work has highlighted several issues in defining a medical problem list, including questions of granularity and performance trade-offs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Integrating decision support systems into telemedicine may optimize consultation efficiency and adherence to clinical guidelines; however, the extent of such effects remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the use of ICD (International Classification of Disease)-coded prescription decision support systems (PDSSs) and the effects of these systems on consultation duration and guideline adherence during telemedicine encounters. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center, observational study conducted from October 2021 to March 2022, adult patients who sought urgent digital care via direct-to-consumer video consultations were included. Physicians had access to current guidelines and could use an ICD-triggered PDSS (which was introduced in January 2022 after a preliminary test in the preceding month) for 26 guideline-based conditions. This study analyzed the impact of implementing automated prescription systems and compared these systems to manual prescription processes in terms of consultation duration and guideline adherence. RESULTS: This study included 10,485 telemedicine encounters involving 9644 patients, with 12,346 prescriptions issued by 290 physicians. Automated prescriptions were used in 5022 (40.67%) of the consultations following system integration. Before introducing decision support, 4497 (36.42%) prescriptions were issued, which increased to 7849 (63.57%) postimplementation. The physician's average consultation time decreased significantly to 9.5 (SD 5.5) minutes from 11.2 (SD 5.9) minutes after PDSS implementation (P<.001). Of the 12,346 prescriptions, 8683 (70.34%) were aligned with disease-specific international guidelines tailored for telemedicine encounters. Primary medication adherence in accordance with existing guidelines was significantly greater in the decision support group than in the manual group (n=4697, 93.53% vs n=1389, 49.14%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the physicians adopted the PDSS, and the results demonstrated the use of the ICD-code system in reducing consultation times and increasing guideline adherence. These systems appear to be valuable for enhancing the efficiency and quality of telemedicine consultations by supporting evidence-based clinical decision-making.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study introduces a temporal condition pattern mining methodology to address the sparse nature of coded condition concept utilization in electronic health record data. As a validation study, we applied this method to reveal condition patterns surrounding an initial diagnosis of pediatric asthma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SPADE (Sequential PAttern Discovery using Equivalence classes) algorithm was used to identify common temporal condition patterns surrounding the initial diagnosis of pediatric asthma in a study population of 71 824 patients from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. SPADE was applied to a dataset with diagnoses coded using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) concepts and separately to a dataset with the ICD codes mapped to their corresponding expanded diagnostic clusters (EDCs). Common temporal condition patterns surrounding the initial diagnosis of pediatric asthma ascertained by SPADE from both the ICD and EDC datasets were compared. RESULTS: SPADE identified 36 unique diagnoses in the mapped EDC dataset, whereas only 19 were recognized in the ICD dataset. Temporal trends in condition diagnoses ascertained from the EDC data were not discoverable in the ICD dataset. DISCUSSION: Mining frequent temporal condition patterns from large electronic health record datasets may reveal previously unknown associations between diagnoses that could inform future research into causation or other relationships. Mapping sparsely coded medical concepts into homogenous groups was essential to discovering potentially useful information from our dataset. CONCLUSIONS: We expect that the presented methodology is applicable to the study of diagnostic trajectories for other clinical conditions and can be extended to study temporal patterns of other coded medical concepts such as medications and procedures.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to validate major bleeding (MB) cases within a cohort of new users of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in Electronic health records (EHRs) from primary care in Spain (BIFAP), introducing more efficient techniques and automating the process of validation in the pharmacoepidemiologic research with EHR data as much as possible. METHODS: Registered bleedings were identified in a cohort of new users of DOACs in BIFAP using ICPC 2 and ICD 9 codes; we ascertained these bleedings as MB through a validation strategy based on the MB definition from the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, which used hospitalization and critical localization as proxies. We assessed hospitalization with hospital discharge information (only available for some years and regions) and a free text-based algorithm created to identify hospitalization in EHR's clinical notes. Incidence rates (IR) of MB were evaluated by bleeding type. RESULTS: The study cohort included 104 614 patients, with 274521.5 p-y of follow up. There were 6143 registered bleedings during the study period (519 intracranial bleeding - ICB, 4606 gastrointestinal bleeding - GIB, 1018 extracranial bleeding - ECB), from which 1679 were confirmed as MB (416 ICB, 1086 GIB, and 177 ECB). The free text-based semi-automatic algorithm had moderate recall (0.59), but high specificity (0.99), and precision (0.94). CONCLUSION: The combination of hospitalization and critical localization is a valid approach to validate MB in EHRs with incomplete information. The use of more automatic methods for case validation instead of manual review of clinical notes is favored.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social determinants affect health, yet there are few systematic clinical strategies in primary care that leverage electronic health record (EHR) automation to facilitate screening for social needs and resource referrals. An EHR-based social determinants of health (SDOH) screening and referral model, adapted from the WE CARE model for pediatrics, was implemented in urban adult primary care. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to: (1) understand the burden of SDOH among patients at Boston Medical Center; and (2) evaluate the feasibility of implementing a systematic clinical strategy to screen new primary care patients for SDOH, use EHR technology to add these needs to the patient's chart through autogenerated ICD-10 codes, and print patient language-congruent referrals to available resources upon patient request. RESEARCH DESIGN: This observational study assessed the number of patients who were screened to be positive and requested resources for social needs. In addition, we evaluated the feasibility of implementing our SDOH strategy by determining the proportion of: eligible patients screened, providers signing orders for positive patient screenings, and provider orders for resource referral guides among patients requesting resource connections. RESULTS: In total, 1696 of 2420 (70%) eligible patients were screened. Employment (12%), food insecurity (11%), and problems affording medications (11%) were the most prevalent concerns among respondents. In total, 367 of 445 (82%) patients with ≥1 identified needs (excluding education) had the appropriate ICD-10 codes added to their visit diagnoses. In total, 325 of 376 (86%) patients who requested resources received a relevant resource referral guide. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a systematic clinical strategy in primary care using EHR workflows was successful in identifying and providing resource information to patients with SDOH needs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The accumulation of medical documents in China has rapidly increased in the past years. We focus on developing a method that automatically performs ICD-10 code assignment to Chinese diagnoses from the electronic medical records to support the medical coding process in Chinese hospitals. METHODS: We propose two encoding methods: one that directly determines the desired code (flat method), and one that hierarchically determines the most suitable code until the desired code is obtained (hierarchical method). Both methods are based on instances from the standard diagnostic library, a gold standard dataset in China. For the first time, semantic similarity estimation between Chinese words are applied in the biomedical domain with the successful implementation of knowledge-based and distributional approaches. Characteristics of the Chinese language are considered in implementing distributional semantics. We test our methods against 16,330 coding instances from our partner hospital. RESULTS: The hierarchical method outperforms the flat method in terms of accuracy and time complexity. Representing distributional semantics using Chinese characters can achieve comparable performance to the use of Chinese words. The diagnoses in the test set can be encoded automatically with micro-averaged precision of 92.57 %, recall of 89.63 %, and F-score of 91.08 %. A sharp decrease in encoding performance is observed without semantic similarity estimation. CONCLUSION: The hierarchical nature of ICD-10 codes can enhance the performance of the automated code assignment. Semantic similarity estimation is demonstrated indispensable in dealing with Chinese medical text. The proposed method can greatly reduce the workload and improve the efficiency of the code assignment process in Chinese hospitals.

AB  - The automated health plan data and data from medical chart abstractions from eight large health maintenance organizations were used to evaluate the positive predictive values (PPVs) of the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9) codes for cases of peptic ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Overall, 207 of 884 cases of peptic ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (23%) were confirmed by surgery, endoscopy, X-ray, or autopsy. The PPVs were 66% for hospitalizations with codes for duodenal ulcer (ICD-9-CM 532), 61% for gastric/gastrojejunal ulcer (ICD-9-CM 531, 534), 1% for peptic ulcer (ICD-9-CM 533), and 9% for gastrointestinal hemorrhage (ICD-9-CM578). The overall and diagnostic category-specific PPVs were generally similar for the various HMOs. This study, using data from a large number of health plans located in different geographical regions, underscores the importance of evaluating the accuracy of the diagnoses from automated health plan databases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Case definitions are essential to epidemiological research. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate ICD-9 codes 410 and 411 to identify cases of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and the clinical information availability in the administrative and hospital discharge records of Saskatchewan, Canada. METHODS: In the context of a safety cohort study, we identified hospitalisations with primary discharge codes 410 (2260) and 411 (799). We selected all records with code 411, and a random sample (200) with code 410. Based on information obtained by trained abstractors from hospital records, events were classified by two cardiologists as definite or possible according to adapted AHA/ESC criteria. The validity of 410 and 411 codes was assessed by calculating the positive predictive value (PPV). Completeness of the recorded information on risk factors and use of aspirin was explored. RESULTS: The PPVs of the codes 410 and 411 for ACS were 0.96 (95%CI: 0. 92-0.98) and 0.86 (95%CI: 0.83-0.88), respectively. The PPV of 410 for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was 0.95 (95%CI: 0.91-0.98). The PPV of 411 was 0.73 (95%CI: 0.70-0.77) for primary unstable angina (UA) and 0.09 (95%CI: 0.07-0.11) for AMI. Hospital charts review revealed key information for clinical variables, smoking, obesity and use of aspirin at admission. CONCLUSIONS: ICD-9 410 code has high PPV for AMI cases, likewise 411 for UA cases. Case validation remains important in epidemiological studies with administrative health databases. Given the pathophysiology of ACS, both AMI and UA might be used as study end points. In addition to code 410, we recommend the use of 411 plus validation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between central nervous system (CNS)-active medication use and the risk of fall-related injury in community-dwelling older adults following dementia onset. Further, to evaluate increased risk at higher doses or with a greater number of CNS-active medication classes. METHODS: Participants included community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older with a dementia diagnosis participating in the Adult Changes in Thought Study. From automated pharmacy data, a time-varying composite measure of CNS-active medication use was created. Central nervous system-active medication use was classified as current (use within prior 30 days), recent (prior 31-90 days), past (prior 91-365 days), and nonuse (no exposure in prior year). For current users, standardized daily doses (SDDs) were calculated for each CNS-active medication and summed across medications, and the number of CNS-active medication classes used was also measured. The outcome was fall-related injury based on emergency department, inpatient, and outpatient International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and external cause of injury (E) codes. RESULTS: Among 793 subjects, 303 fall-related injuries occurred over a mean follow-up of 3.7 years (2907 total person-years). Relative to nonuse, fall risk was significantly higher for current use (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% confidence internal [CI] 1.19-2.12) but not for past or recent use. Among current users, increased risk was seen across SDD levels: HRs (95% CI): 1.77 (1.19-2.62), 1.79 (1.25-2.56), and 1.35 (0.96-1.92) for less than 1 SDD, 1 to less than 2 SDDs, and 2 or more SDDs, respectively (trend test, p=0.14). A trend was seen for increasing risk with a greater number of CNS-active medication classes; however, this was not statistically significant (trend test, p=0.084). CONCLUSIONS: Current use of CNS-active medications was associated with fall-related injury in community-dwelling older adults followed from time of dementia onset, with increased risk even with use of low doses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) are different conditions with different treatments. However, they are coded in electronic health records with the same International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) code (M54.5) and can be differentiated only by retrospective chart reviews. This prevents an efficient definition of data-driven guidelines for billing and therapy recommendations, such as return-to-work options. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of automatically distinguishing acute LBP episodes by analyzing free-text clinical notes. METHODS: We used a dataset of 17,409 clinical notes from different primary care practices; of these, 891 documents were manually annotated as acute LBP and 2973 were generally associated with LBP via the recorded ICD-10 code. We compared different supervised and unsupervised strategies for automated identification: keyword search, topic modeling, logistic regression with bag of n-grams and manual features, and deep learning (a convolutional neural network-based architecture [ConvNet]). We trained the supervised models using either manual annotations or ICD-10 codes as positive labels. RESULTS: ConvNet trained using manual annotations obtained the best results with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 and an F score of 0.70. ConvNet's results were also robust to reduction of the number of manually annotated documents. In the absence of manual annotations, topic models performed better than methods trained using ICD-10 codes, which were unsatisfactory for identifying LBP acuity. CONCLUSIONS: This study uses clinical notes to delineate a potential path toward systematic learning of therapeutic strategies, billing guidelines, and management options for acute LBP at the point of care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the conversion rate of laparoscopic or robotic to open sacrocolpopexy and to identify associated factors in a large population-based database. METHODS: We used Health Care Cost and Utilization Project-National Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS) databases 2005-2014. We extracted data on apical suspension and synthetic mesh with laparoscopy or robot in adult women using International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. We evaluated the rate of conversion and used logistic regression to study the association with risk factors. RESULTS: We identified 3295 women with laparoscopic or robotic sacrocolpopexies. There were 2777 robotic procedures with 37 conversion (1.33%) and 518 laparoscopic procedures with 37 conversions (7.14%), with an overall conversion rate of 2.2%. Median age was 62 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 55-69]. Concomitant hysterectomy was significantly more frequent in the robotic than laparascopic group (41.7% versus 13.9%, p < 0.01) and was not associated with conversion. Factors associated with lower conversion included a robotic approach (adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 0.32 [95% CI 0.19-0.54]) and private insurance (aOR 0.53 [95% CI 0.32-0.86]). Factors associated with higher conversion were obesity (aOR 3.27 [95% CI 1.72-6.19]) and lysis of adhesions (aOR 3.32 [95% CI 1.89-5.85]). Accidental organ puncture was significantly associated with conversion (14.9% versus 3.8%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this American database, the rate of conversion of laparoscopic or robotic to open sacrocolpopexy was low. The majority (84%) of minimally invasive sacrocolpopexies used a robotic approach, which was associated with a lower risk of conversion. Obesity and lysis of adhesions were associated with a higher risk of conversion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to assess the accuracy of cause-of-death coding, determine the extent to which coders follow the selection rules of coding set out in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9), and the effects of miscoding on mortality statistics in Taiwan. METHOD: A systematic sample of 5621 death certificates was reviewed. The underlying cause of death (UCD) selected by the reviewer for each death certificate was compared with that selected by the original coder. The UCD was selected according to ACME (Automated Classification of Medical Entities) Decision Tables. RESULTS: The overall agreement rates between the reviewer and coders according to the three-digit and two-digit categories of ICD-9 were 80.9% and 83.9%, respectively. Good agreement was found for malignant neoplasms (kappa = 0.94) and injuries and poisoning (kappa = 0.97), but there was poor agreement for nephrotic diseases (kappa = 0.74), hypertension-related diseases (kappa = 0.74), and cerebral infarction (kappa = 0.77). Reasons for disagreements included disagreement in nomenclature (42.8%), inappropriate judgement of causal relationships (41.5%), and incorrect interpretation of Selection Rule 3 and Modification Rules (15.7%). CONCLUSION: This study showed various levels of agreement for different diseases between the reviewer and the original coders in selection of the UCD. Owing to the 'compensatory effect of errors', the national mortality statistics were not affected significantly. The national administration should undertake routine internal studies to control the quality of UCD coding practices.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for the identification of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) preoperatively using routinely available clinical data from electronic health records. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used first-order logic rules (if-then-else rules) to imply the presence or absence of DM types 1 and 2. The "if" clause of each rule is a conjunction of logical  RESULTS: A total of 4208 surgical patients (mean age, 52 years; males, 48%) were analyzed to develop the phenotyping algorithm. Expert review identified 685 patients (16.28% of the full cohort) as having DM. Our proposed method identified 684 patients (16.25%) as having DM. The algorithm performed well-99.70% sensitivity, 99.97% specificity-and compared favorably with previous approaches. CONCLUSION: Among patients undergoing surgery, determination of DM can be made with high accuracy using simple, computationally efficient rules. Knowledge of patients' DM status before surgery may alter physicians' care plan and reduce postsurgical complications. Nevertheless, future efforts are necessary to determine the effect of first-order logic rules on clinical processes and patient outcomes.

AB  - Patients report their symptoms and subjective experiences in their own words. These expressions may be clinically meaningful yet are difficult to capture using automated methods. We annotated subjective symptom expressions in 750 clinical notes from the Veterans Affairs EHR. Within each document, subjective symptom expressions were compared to mentions of symptoms in clinical terms and to the assigned ICD-9-CM codes for the encounter. A total of 543 subjective symptom expressions were identified, of which 66.5% were categorized as mental/behavioral experiences and 33.5% somatic experiences. Only two subjective expressions were coded using ICD-9-CM. Subjective expressions were restated in semantically related clinical terms in 246 (45.3%) instances. Nearly one third (31%) of subjective expressions were not coded or restated in standard terminology. The results highlight the diversity of symptom descriptions and the opportunities to further develop natural language processing to extract symptom expressions that are unobtainable by other automated methods.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to validate an algorithm for identifying patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN) and demonstrate its practical applications. Using the Kaiser Permanente Colorado Diabetes Registry, an algorithm was developed with selected ICD-9 diagnosis codes combined with automated pharmacy data for medications prescribed for pDPN symptoms. Medical records were reviewed to confirm pDPN presence and to inform algorithm refinement. Prevalence was estimated with a numerator of members with diabetes who had inclusion but no exclusion codes in 2003 (Method 1) and with a numerator of diabetes patients with inclusion codes between 1998 and 2003 who had no subsequent exclusion codes and who remained members in 2003 (Method 2); the denominator was all members with diabetes in 2003. Medication utilization was compared between patients with and without pDPN. A total of 19,577 members with diabetes were identified; 2612 met initial inclusion criteria. Medical record review (n = 298) demonstrated sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 55%, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 64%. Inclusion criteria were modified and pharmacy data eliminated. The revised algorithm identified 1754 additional patients meeting inclusion criteria. Medical record review (n = 190) demonstrated sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 49%, and PPV of 79%. Using the validated algorithm, pDPN prevalence was 113 (Method 1) and 208 (Method 2) per 1000 persons with diabetes. Significant differences were observed in medication prescriptions between patients with and without pDPN. Estimated pDPN prevalence among persons with diabetes was 11%-21% and pDPN patients had greater utilization of selected medications than those without pDPN. Identifying patients with pDPN is a fundamental step for improving disease management and understanding the economic impact of pDPN.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasingly research studies use HES (Hospital Episode Statistics) data to report clinical outcomes. No data exists on the performance of individual ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision) diagnostic codes for identifying major bleeding events. Data from the ROBOT-ACS study provide a unique opportunity to assess this compared to conventionally adjudicated bleeding by standard definitions. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed on the 1172 HES records from ROBOT-ACS follow up data containing bleeding or anaemia codes. The 213 adjudicated major bleeds in ROBOT-ACS served as the gold standard comparator. Individual bleeding codes, and groups by type, were assessed for their positive predictive value (PPV). RESULTS: The PPV of most codes for major bleeding were poor, generally < 50%. The best performing group of codes were relating to intracranial haemorrhage. 26 of 213 adjudicated bleeding events in ROBOT-ACS would be missed if anaemia codes were not considered. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of diagnostic ICD-10 codes in HES, without further interrogation, for determining major bleeding events is poor. Whilst sensitivity is likely to be favourable, differentiating major bleeding is challenging. Options for using HES data to determine bleeding in cardiovascular studies would be either a hybrid approach, with HES screening followed by records review, or creating a new definition of significant bleeding using data more readily available in HES. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ROBOT-ACS is registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02484924. Registered 30/6/2015.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data collected by general practitioners (GPs) may provide potential for health services research. In this study, we investigated if clinical questions can be answered with GPs' electronic medical records (EMRs) by means of diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHOD: Patients diagnosed with CAP, defined as ICD code J18.9, were identified in the fourth quarter of 2021. The data were derived from the EMR system (Medical Office®) of a central German association of 30 general practices, using three different approaches: 1. The integrated statistic tool was used to record whether patients were referred for radiological diagnostic confirmation. 2. Retrospectively, EMRs were evaluated manually by a doctor familiar with the EMR. 3. The raw data of the EMR system were extracted by automated export. The information obtained through the three types of access was compared. For each patient case, detailed comments on problems and specifics were documented and evaluated by qualitative content analysis (QCA) according to Mayring. RESULTS: In total, 164 patients diagnosed with CAP were identified. The numbers of documented radiological diagnostic confirmations varied between data approaches: While the manual evaluation of the EMRs revealed 60 referred patients, the statistics tool identified 38 of these cases. The export of the raw data identified 58 referrals to radiography after adjustment. According to QCA, there was a high variation in applied diagnostics and time of diagnosis. Referrals for radiography were made both before and after coding of the diagnosis. In case of hospitalization, X-rays were usually performed during the inpatient stay. Laboratory tests were performed as an alternative to radiography. There was also a high variation in the documentation of risk factors and diagnostic certainty. DISCUSSION: The statistics tool integrated into the EMR system is a quick way to perform simple queries but proved to be impracticable for complex questions. The EMRs provide detailed information but need to be evaluated manually. An automated data export from the raw data offers both detailed information and access to large volumes of data but requires complex preparation and appropriate IT expertise. CONCLUSION: Based on the example of diagnosed CAP in a GP setting, the use of data extracted from an EMR system seems to be feasible to answer simple clinical questions. However, it is necessary to adapt the data export, and a comparison with a small number of manually evaluated cases is useful to achieve valid results.

AB  - Purpose Data mining algorithms using electronic health records (EHRs) are useful in large-scale population-wide studies to classify etiology and comorbidities (Casey et al., 2016). Here, we apply this approach to developmental language disorder (DLD), a prevalent communication disorder whose risk factors and epidemiology remain largely undiscovered. Method We first created a reliable system for manually identifying DLD in EHRs based on speech-language pathologist (SLP) diagnostic expertise. We then developed and validated an automated algorithmic procedure, called, Automated Phenotyping Tool for identifying DLD cases in health systems data (APT-DLD), that classifies a DLD status for patients within EHRs on the basis of ICD (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) codes. APT-DLD was validated in a discovery sample (

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) employs trained nurse data collectors to prospectively gather preoperative patient characteristics and 30-day postoperative outcomes for most major operations in 123 DVA hospitals to provide risk-adjusted outcomes to centers as quality indicators. It has been suggested that routine hospital discharge abstracts contain the same information and would provide accurate and complete data at much lower cost. STUDY DESIGN: With preoperative risks and 30-day outcomes recorded by trained data collectors as criteria standards, ICD-9-CM hospital discharge diagnosis codes in the Patient Treatment File (PTF) were tested for sensitivity and positive predictive value. ICD-9-CM codes for 61 preoperative patient characteristics and 21 postoperative adverse events were identified. RESULTS: Moderately good ICD-9-CM matches of descriptions were found for 37 NSQIP preoperative patient characteristics (61%); good data were available from other automated sources for another 15 (25%). ICD-9-CM coding was available for only 13 (45%) of the top 29 predictor variables. In only three (23%) was sensitivity and in only four (31%) was positive predictive value greater than 0.500. There were ICD-9-CM matches for all 21 NSQIP postoperative adverse events; multiple matches were appropriate for most. Postoperative occurrence was implied in only 41%; same breadth of clinical description in only 23%. In only four (7%) was sensitivity and only two (4%) was positive predictive value greater than 0.500. CONCLUSION: Sensitivity and positive predictive value of administrative data in comparison to NSQIP data were poor. We cannot recommend substitution of administrative data for NSQIP data methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radical prostatectomies can be performed using open retropubic, laparoscopic, or robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. The literature shows that short-term outcomes (in particular, inpatient complications) differ depending on the type of procedure. To date, these differences have only been examined and confirmed in isolated cases based on national routine data. METHODS: The data was based on the Swiss Medical Statistics from 2016 to 2018 from a national survey of administrative data from all Swiss hospitals. Cases with the coded main diseases neoplasm of the prostate (ICD C61) and the main treatments of laparoscopic (CHOP 60.5X.20) or retropubic (CHOP 60.5X.30) radical prostatectomies were included, resulting in a total sample size of 8,593 cases. RESULTS: A procedure-related complication occurred in 998 cases (11.6%). By surgical procedure, complication rates were 10.1% for robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy 9.0% for conventional laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and 17.1% for open retropubic radical prostatectomy (p < 0.001). Conventional and robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies had a significantly lower risk of complications than retropubic procedures. Moreover, the risk of a procedure-related complication was almost twice as high in cases operated on retropubically; however, no significant difference was found between conventional and robotic-assisted laparoscopic cases. DISCUSSION: The use of a surgical robot showed no advantages in radical prostatectomies regarding procedure-related during the hospital stay. However, both conventional and robotic-assisted laparoscopically operated radical prostatectomies show better results than open retropubic procedures. Further studies on the long-term course of patients based on claims data are needed to confirm the inherent benefits of surgical robots in tandem with them being increasingly employed in hospitals.

AB  - Systemic infections, particularly bacterial etiologies, are the leading cause of hospitalization, decompensation, and mortality in patients with cirrhosis, emphasizing the need for accurate and timely identification. Reliable infection labeling is crucial for developing clinical decision support tools and predictive models. However, existing methods, such as ICD codes and manual chart reviews, are unreliable, labor-intensive, and lack scalability. This study leverages a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), Claude 3.5 Sonnet, deployed on a HIPAA-compliant AWS instance, to automate infection identification from the first 48 hours of clinical notes in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. Gold-standard infection labels were created through manual physician chart reviews. Results from 196 cases demonstrated the LLM's robust performance, achieving 89.8% accuracy, 97.9% sensitivity, and a PPV of 89.1% compared to physician chart review. Additionally, the model identified multiple pathogen types and infection locations in complex cases. These findings validate the potential of LLMs as scalable and efficient tools for infection classification, paving the way for AI-driven methodologies in infection management.Clinical Relevance- This study demonstrates the potential of large language models to automate infection identification and classification in patients with cirrhosis, improving accuracy and scalability beyond traditional methods.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between substance use disorder (SUD) and intimate partner violence (IPV) screening and management practices in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult ED patients presenting to an urban, tertiary care teaching hospital over a 4-month period. An automated electronic data abstraction process identified consecutive patients and retrieved visit characteristics, including results of three violence screening questions, demographic data, triage acuity, time of visit, and International Classifications of Disease, 9th revision (ICD-9), diagnosis codes. Data on management were collected using a standardized abstraction tool by two reviewers masked to the study question. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of screening and management. RESULTS: In 10,071 visits, 6,563 violence screens were completed. IPV screening was documented in 33.5% of patients with alcohol-related diagnoses (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27.7% to 39.3%, chi(2) = 116.78, p < 0.001) and 53.3% of patients with drug-related diagnoses (95% CI = 44.3% to 62.3%, chi(2) = 7.69, p = 0.006), compared to 66.1% of patients without these diagnoses (95% CI = 65.2% to 67.1%). In the multivariate analysis, alcohol (odds ratio [OR] = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.40) and drug use (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.83) were associated with decreased odds of screening. Of completed screens, 429 (6.5%) were positive, but violence was addressed further in only 55.7% of patients. Substance abuse did not appear to affect the odds of having positive screens addressed further by providers (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 0.39 to 10.14). CONCLUSIONS: This study found an association between SUD and decreased odds of IPV screening. Failure to screen for IPV in the setting of substance use may represent a missed opportunity to address a critical health issue and be a barrier to successful intervention.

AB  - Computer-based patient data which are represented in a coded form have a variety of uses, including direct patient care, statistical reporting, automated decision support, and clinical research. No standard exists which supports all of these functions. Abstracting coding systems, such as ICD, CPT, DRGs and MeSH fail to provide adequate detail, forcing application developers to create their own coding schemes for systems. Some of these schemes have been put forward as possible standards, but they have not been widely accepted. This paper reviews existing schemes used for abstracting, electronic record systems, and comprehensive coding. It also discusses the remaining impediments to acceptance of standards and the current efforts to overcome them, including SNOMED, the Gabrieli Medical Nomenclature, the Read Clinical Codes, GALEN, and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).

AB  - To develop an algorithm to identify sepsis and sepsis with organ dysfunction/septic shock in burn-injured patients incorporating criteria from the American Burn Association sepsis definition that possesses good test characteristics compared with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9) codes and an algorithm previously validated in nonburn-injured septic patients (Martin et al method). This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients admitted to the burn intensive care unit between January 2008 and March 2015. Of the 4761 admitted, 8.6% (n = 407) met inclusion criteria, of which the case rate for sepsis was 34.2% (n = 139; n = 48 sepsis; n = 91 sepsis with organ dysfunction/septic shock). For sepsis identification, the novel algorithm had an accuracy of 86.0% (95% CI: 82.2-89.2%), sensitivity of 66.9% (95% CI: 59.1-74.7%), and specificity of 95.9% (95% CI: 93.5-98.3%). The novel algorithm had better discrimination (0.81, 95% CI: 0.77-0.86) than the ICD-9 method (0.77, 95% CI: 0.73-0.81), although this was not significant (P = .08). For sepsis with organ dysfunction/septic shock, the novel algorithm plus vasopressors (0.67, 95% CI: 0.63-0.72) and the ICD-9 method (0.63, 95% CI: 0.58-0.68) performed equivocal (P = 0.15) but the Martin method (0.76, 95% CI: 0.71-0.81) had superior discrimination than other methods (P < .01). The novel algorithm is an accurate and simple tool to identify sepsis in the burn cohort with good sensitivity and specificity and equivocal discriminative ability to ICD-9 coding. The Martin method had superior discriminative ability for identifying sepsis with organ dysfunction/septic shock in burn-injured patients than either the novel algorithm plus vasopressors or ICD-9 coding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Agomelatine is a melatonin receptor agonist and serotonin 5-HT OBJECTIVE: The goal was to estimate the risk of ALI associated with agomelatine and other antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, and amitriptyline) when compared with citalopram in routine clinical practice. METHOD: A nested case-control study was conducted using data sources in Denmark, Germany, Spain, and Sweden (study period 2009-2014). Three ALI endpoints were defined using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes: primary (specific codes) and secondary (all codes) endpoints used only hospital discharge codes; the tertiary endpoint included both inpatient and outpatient settings (all codes). Validation of endpoints was implemented. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for current use were estimated for each data source and combined. RESULTS: We evaluated 3,238,495 new antidepressant and 74,440 agomelatine users. For the primary endpoint, the OR for agomelatine versus citalopram was 0.48 (CI 0.13-1.71). Results were also < 1 when no exclusion criteria were applied (OR 0.37; CI 0.19-0.74), when all exclusion criteria except alcohol and drug abuse were applied (OR 0.47; CI 0.20-1.07), and for the secondary (OR 0.40; CI 0.05-3.11) and tertiary (OR 0.79; CI 0.50-1.25) endpoints. Regarding other antidepressants versus citalopram, most OR point estimates were also below one, although with varying widths of the 95% CIs. The result of the tertiary endpoint and the sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were the most precise. CONCLUSION: In this study, using citalopram as a comparator, agomelatine was not associated with an increased risk of ALI hospitalisation. The results for agomelatine should be interpreted in the context of the European risk minimisation measures in place. Those measures may have induced selective prescribing and could explain the lower risk of ALI for agomelatine when compared with citalopram. Most other antidepressants evaluated had ORs suggesting a lower risk than citalopram, but additional studies are required to confirm or refute these results.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Utilization of robotic assistance is increasing for total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, few studies have directly examined the efficacy of this technique at reducing complications. This research aims to compare the rates of perioperative complications of robotic-assisted THA (RA-THA) with conventional THA (C-THA). METHODS: This study screened more than 35 million hospital discharges between 2010 to 2014 using the National Inpatient Sample. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes were used to identify 292,836 patients who underwent C-THA (ICD 81.51) and 946 patients who underwent RA-THA (ICD 81.51 and ICD 17.41, 17.49). Perioperative complications were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. Patient mortality was determined using the Uniform Bill patient disposition. The RA-THA cohort was statistically matched 1:1 to C-THA about patient age, sex, race, comorbidities, hospital type, and calendar year. Mean cost and length of stay (LOS) for each cohort were calculated and compared using the Kruskal-Wallis H test. Logistic regression was used to compare the risks of major and minor complications between the cohorts. RESULTS: We matched 758 (80.13%) RA-THA patients with 758 patients who underwent C-THA. No patient in our sample died. When compared with the conventional group, multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of major complications was similar in RA-THA patients (odds ratio = 0.698, 95% confidence interval = 0.282 to 1.727). In addition, although the rate of minor complications was higher in the RA-THA cohort (21.6% versus 12.5%, P = 0.004), no difference was observed on multivariate analysis (odds ratio = 1.248, 95% confidence interval = 0.852 to 1.829). The average inpatient hospital cost of a RA-THA was $20,046 (SD = 6,165) compared with $18,258 (SD = 6,147) for C-THA (P < 0.001). The average LOS was for RA-THA was 2.69 days (SD = 1.25) compared with 2.82 days for C-THA (SD = 1.18, P < 0.001). DISCUSSION: In a statistically matched cohort, the risk of perioperative complication in patients who underwent RA-THA versus C-THA patients were similar. However, RA-THA was costlier despite shorter LOS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective cohort analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic surgery has become the standard of care for the most common surgical procedures performed. However, laparoscopic techniques have not reached this same penetrance in colorectal surgery. We wanted to determine the percentage of colon operations performed in Texas that were done via laparoscopic, robotic and open techniques. METHODS: The Texas Inpatient Public Use Data File (PUDF) was queried using ICD-9-CM diagnostic and procedure codes to determine overall utilization of laparoscopic colectomies (LC) in Texas between 2013-14 for reporting facilities. We specifically looked at cost and the length of stay for LC, open colectomy (OC) and robotic assisted colectomy (RAC). RESULTS: In the state of Texas between 2013-14 there were 20,454 colectomies performed. Of these 12,328 (60.3%) were OC, 7,536 (36.8%) were LC, and 590 (3.9%) were RAC. Average total cost was $117,113 for OC, $75,741.9 for LC, and $81,996.2 for RAC. Average length of stay for each technique was 10.6 days for OC, 6.1 days for LC, and 5.1 days for RAC. The risk of a postoperative complication occurring was higher in the open procedure than a laparoscopic procedure. CONCLUSIONS: LC accounted for only 36.8% of all colectomies performed in Texas between 2013-14. OC costs twice as much as LC and increased the length of stay by nearly 4 d. LC and RAC are both associated with significantly less cost and length of stay for patients undergoing surgery, while lowering perioperative complications.

AB  - Early detection of unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance saves lives and prevents harmful consequences. We propose a novel data mining approach to signaling potential ADRs from electronic health databases. More specifically, we introduce potential causal association rules (PCARs) to represent the potential causal relationship between a drug and ICD-9 (CDC. (2010). International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). [Online]. Available: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.html) coded signs or symptoms representing potential ADRs. Due to the infrequent nature of ADRs, the existing frequency-based data mining methods cannot effectively discover PCARs. We introduce a new interestingness measure, potential causal leverage, to quantify the degree of association of a PCAR. This measure is based on the computational, experience-based fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we developed previously (Y. Ji, R. M. Massanari, J. Ager, J. Yen, R. E. Miller, and H. Ying, "A fuzzy logic-based computational recognition-primed decision model," Inf. Sci., vol. 177, pp. 4338-4353, 2007) on the basis of the well-known, psychology-originated qualitative RPD model (G. A. Klein, "A recognition-primed decision making model of rapid decision making," in Decision Making in Action: Models and Methods, 1993, pp. 138-147). The potential causal leverage assesses the strength of the association of a drug-symptom pair given a collection of patient cases. To test our data mining approach, we retrieved electronic medical data for 16,206 patients treated by one or more than eight drugs of our interest at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit between 2007 and 2009. We selected enalapril as the target drug for this ADR signal generation study. We used our algorithm to preliminarily evaluate the associations between enalapril and all the ICD-9 codes associated with it. The experimental results indicate that our approach has a potential to better signal potential ADRs than risk ratio and leverage, two traditional frequency-based measures. Among the top 50 signal pairs (i.e., enalapril versus symptoms) ranked by the potential causal-leverage measure, the physicians on the project determined that eight of them probably represent true causal associations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumor documentation in Germany is currently a largely manual process. It involves reading the textual patient documentation and filling in forms in dedicated databases to obtain structured data. Advances in information extraction techniques that build on large language models (LLMs) could have the potential for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of this process. Evaluating LLMs in the German medical domain, especially their ability to interpret specialized language, is essential to determine their suitability for the use in clinical documentation. Due to data protection regulations, only locally deployed open source LLMs are generally suitable for this application. METHODS: The evaluation employs eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1 to 70 billion model parameters. Three basic tasks were selected as representative examples for the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. RESULTS: The models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation. CONCLUSIONS: Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval . We also release the data set under https://huggingface.co/datasets/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEvalSet providing a valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Brighton Collaboration Global Alignment of Immunization Safety in Pregnancy (GAIA) project developed case definitions for the assessment of adverse events in mothers and infants following maternal immunization. This study evaluated the applicability of these definitions to data collected in routine clinical care and research trial records across 7 sites in high-resource settings. METHODS: Data collection forms were designed and used to retrospectively abstract the key elements of the GAIA definitions from records for 5 neonatal and 5 maternal outcomes, as well as gestational age. Level of diagnostic certainty was assessed by the data abstractor and an independent clinician, and then verified by Automated Brighton Case logic. The ability to assign a level of diagnostic certainty for each outcome and the positive predictive value (PPV) for their respective ICD-10 codes were evaluated. RESULTS: Data from 1248 case records were abstracted: 624 neonatal and 622 maternal. Neonatal outcomes were most likely to be assessable and assigned by the level of diagnostic certainty. PPV for preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age and respiratory distress were all above 75%. Maternal outcomes for preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction showed PPV over 80%. However, microcephaly (neonatal outcome) and dysfunctional labor (maternal outcome) were often nonassessable, with low PPVs. CONCLUSIONS: The applicability of GAIA case definitions to retrospectively ascertain and classify maternal and neonatal outcomes was variable among sites in high-resource settings. The implementation of the case definitions is largely dependent on the type and quality of documentation in clinical and research records in both high- and low-resource settings. While designed for use in the prospective evaluation of maternal vaccine safety, the GAIA case definitions would likely need to be specifically adapted for observational studies using alternative sources of data, linking various data sources and allowing flexibility in the ascertainment of the elements and levels of certainty of the case definition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Automated procedures are increasingly used in cancer registration, and it is important that the data produced are systematically checked for consistency and accuracy. We evaluated an automated procedure for cancer registration adopted by the Lombardy Cancer Registry in 1997, comparing automatically-generated diagnostic codes with those produced manually over one year (1997). METHODS: The automatically generated cancer cases were produced by Open Registry algorithms. For manual registration, trained staff consulted clinical records, pathology reports and death certificates. The social security code, present and checked in both databases in all cases, was used to match the files in the automatic and manual databases. The cancer cases generated by the two methods were compared by manual revision. RESULTS: The automated procedure generated 5027 cases: 2959 (59%) were accepted automatically and 2068 (41%) were flagged for manual checking. Among the cases accepted automatically, discrepancies in data items (surname, first name, sex and date of birth) constituted 8.5% of cases, and discrepancies in the first three digits of the ICD-9 code constituted 1.6%. Among flagged cases, cancers of female genital tract, hematopoietic system, metastatic and ill-defined sites, and oropharynx predominated. The usual reasons were use of specific vs. generic codes, presence of multiple primaries, and use of extranodal vs. nodal codes for lymphomas. The percentage of automatically accepted cases ranged from 83% for breast and thyroid cancers to 13% for metastatic and ill-defined cancer sites. CONCLUSION: Since 59% of cases were accepted automatically and contained relatively few, mostly trivial discrepancies, the automatic procedure is efficient for routine case generation effectively cutting the workload required for routine case checking by this amount. Among cases not accepted automatically, discrepancies were mainly due to variations in coding practice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Double-J® ureteral stents are temporary tubes used for ureteral patency that can cause serious complications if left beyond the allotted time. We developed a streamlined framework that allows for Double-J stent tracking to alert patients to the need for removal. METHODS: By creating a multidisciplinary committee we developed a database of patients with Double-J stents who presented to our facility between 2012 and 2014. The database was populated by a query of the billing system, generating HIPAA compliant stent removal reminder letters. Three queries (A, B and C) were developed using a combination of billing codes and each query was compared to a gold standard list. RESULTS: The ICD-9 ureteral catheterization code used to perform query A was only 28% sensitive. Query B (using CPT or HCPCS codes) was 98% sensitive. However, it incorrectly captured many patients with nonureteral stents. Our final query method, query C, rectified this issue by using the ICD-9 code with CPT or HCPCS codes, resulting in the highest sensitivity (78%) while minimizing undesired stent capture. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an automated and reproducible program that correctly identifies and alerts a high percentage of patients to the need to remove their stent. Repeated audits of our query methods combined with regular meetings of a multidisciplinary Double-J stent committee were integral to developing and maintaining this system. By promoting proactive awareness for patients as well as physicians, we are working to minimize the incidence of retained Double-J stents and associated complications.

AB  - Automated identification of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD ≥ III) and of no known kidney disease (NKD) can support both clinicians and researchers. We hypothesized that identification of CKD and NKD can be improved, by combining information from different electronic health record (EHR) resources, comprising laboratory values, discharge summaries and ICD-10 billing codes, compared to using each component alone. We included EHRs from 785 elderly multimorbid patients, hospitalized between 2010 and 2015, that were divided into a training and a test (n = 156) dataset. We used both the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) with a 95% confidence interval for evaluation of different classification models. In the test dataset, the combination of EHR components as a simple classifier identified CKD ≥ III (AUROC 0.96[0.93-0.98]) and NKD (AUROC 0.94[0.91-0.97]) better than laboratory values (AUROC CKD 0.85[0.79-0.90], NKD 0.91[0.87-0.94]), discharge summaries (AUROC CKD 0.87[0.82-0.92], NKD 0.84[0.79-0.89]) or ICD-10 billing codes (AUROC CKD 0.85[0.80-0.91], NKD 0.77[0.72-0.83]) alone. Logistic regression and machine learning models improved recognition of CKD ≥ III compared to the simple classifier if only laboratory values were used (AUROC 0.96[0.92-0.99] vs. 0.86[0.81-0.91],

AB  - UNLABELLED: Cancer registries are collections of curated data about malignant tumor diseases. The amount of data processed by cancer registries increases every year, making manual registration more and more tedious. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop an automatic analysis pipeline that would be able to identify and preprocess registry input for incident prostate adenocarcinomas in a French regional cancer registry. METHODS: Notifications from different sources submitted to the Bas-Rhin cancer registry were used here: pathology data and, ICD 10 diagnosis codes from hospital discharge data and healthcare insurance data. We trained a Support Vector Machine model (machine learning) to predict whether patient's data must be considered or not as a prostate adenocarcinoma incident case that should therefore be registered. The final registration of all identified cases was manually confirmed by a specialized technician. Text mining tools (regular expressions) were used to extract clinical and biological data from non-structured pathology reports. RESULTS: We performed two successive analyses. First, we used 982 cases manually labeled by registrars from the 2014 dataset to predict the registration of 785 cases submitted in 2015. Then, we repeated the procedure using the 2089 cases labeled by registrars from the 2014 and 2015 datasets to predict the registration of 926 cases submitted in the 2016 data. The algorithm identified 663 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma in 2015, and 610 in 2016. From these findings, 663 and 531 cases were respectively added to the registry; and 641 and 512 cases were confirmed by the specialized technician. This registration process has achieved a precision level above 96 %. The algorithm obtained an overall precision of 99 % (99.5 % in 2015 and 98.5 % in 2016) and a recall of 97 % (97.8 % in 2015 and 96.9 % in 2016). When the information was found in pathology report, text mining was more than 90 % accuracy for major indicators: PSA test, Gleason score, and incidence date). For both PSA and tumor side, information was not detected in the majority of cases." CONCLUSION: Machine learning was able to identify new cases of prostate cancer, and text mining was able to prefill the data about incident cases. Machine-learning-based automation of the registration process could reduce delays in data production and allow investigators to devote more time to complex tasks and analysis.

We assessed the sensitivity and positive predictive value of novel combinations of these data to classify type 1 versus type 2 diabetes among 210 individuals. We applied an optimized algorithm to a live, prospective, EHR-based surveillance system and reviewed 100 additional cases for validation. RESULTS: The diabetes algorithm flagged 43,177 patients. All criteria contributed unique cases: 78% had diabetes diagnosis codes, 66% fulfilled laboratory criteria, and 46% had suggestive prescriptions. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of ICD-9 codes for type 1 diabetes were 26% (95% CI 12-49) and 94% (83-100) for type 1 codes alone; 90% (81-95) and 57% (33-86) for two or more type 1 codes plus any number of type 2 codes. An optimized algorithm incorporating the ratio of type 1 versus type 2 codes, plasma C-peptide and autoantibody levels, and suggestive prescriptions flagged 66 of 66 (100% [96-100]) patients with type 1 diabetes. On validation, the optimized algorithm correctly classified 35 of 36 patients with type 1 diabetes (raw sensitivity, 97% [87-100], population-weighted sensitivity, 65% [36-100], and positive predictive value, 88% [78-98]). CONCLUSIONS: Algorithms applied to EHR data detect more cases of diabetes than claims codes and reasonably discriminate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Analysis of COPD mortality based only on the underlying cause of death (UCOD) derived from death certificates underestimates disease burden. We analyzed the burden of COPD, as well as the pattern of reporting COPD and its co-morbidities in death certificates, using multiple-cause of death (MCOD) records. METHODS: All 220,281 death certificates of decedents aged ≥ 40 years in the Veneto region (northeastern Italy) were analyzed through 2008-2012. The UCOD was selected by the Automated Classification of Medical Entities software. COPD was defined by ICD-10 codes J40-J44 and J47 based either on the UCOD or on any mention of COPD in death certificates (MCOD). Annual age-standardized COPD death rates were computed for 40-85 year-old subjects. RESULTS: COPD was mentioned in 7.9% (and selected as the UCOD in 2.7%) of death certificates. In about half of these, COPD was mentioned in Part II only. After circulatory and neoplastic diseases, the most frequent chronic diseases reported in certificates with any mention of COPD were diabetes (15.2%) and dementia/Alzheimer (8.9%). Between 2008 and 2012, age-standardized death rates (/100,000/year) decreased from 39.8 to 34.0 in males and from 12.7 to 11.3 in females in the UCOD analyses. These trends were confirmed, although figures were three times greater, in the MCOD analyses. CONCLUSIONS: MCOD analysis should be adopted to fully evaluate the burden of COPD-related mortality. Our findings support a decreasing trend in COPD-related mortality in northeastern Italy between 2008 and 2012, in line with other recent studies in Europe and beyond.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To determine how robotic prostatectomy affects practice patterns of urologists, we examined the case volume characteristics among certifying urologists for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer. We hypothesized that the utilization of open and robotic prostatectomy as well as lymph node dissection changed dynamically over the last 10 years. METHODS: A total of 6-month case log data of certifying urologists from 2003 to 2013 were obtained for the American Board of Urology. Cases were identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes for open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and laparoscopic or robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) with a corresponding diagnosis of prostate cancer as defined by ICD-9 code 185.0. RESULTS OBTAINED: A total of 6,563 urologists submitted case logs, of which 68% (4,470/6,563) reported performing at least one radical prostatectomy (RP), totaling 46,030 RPs logged. There was a 376% increase in the performance of RALP over the study period with robotic volume increasing from 22% of all RP in 2003 to 85% in 2013. Among surgeons performing ORP, the median number performed was 2; of surgeons who performed RALP, the median number performed was 8 (P<0.001). Overall, 39% of surgeons logging ORP performed 2 or fewer RP, whereas 19% of surgeons who performed RALP performed 2 or less RP (P<0.001). The highest volume robotic surgeons (top 10% surgical volume) performed 41% of all RALP with the highest performing robotic surgeon recording 658 prostatectomies over 6 months. Oncologists represented 4.1% of all surgeons performing RP and performed 15.1% of all RP (P<0.001); general urologists performed the majority of RP (57.8%). When performed open, there was no influence of surgeon specialty on the performance of lymph node dissection (LND); if performed robotically, oncologists were significantly more likely to perform LND compared with general surgeons (47% vs. 25.9%, respectively, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Robotic prostatectomies are performed 5 times more commonly than open prostatectomy and represent 85% of all RP performed by board-certified urologists in 2013. Compared to RALP, ORP are significantly more likely to be performed by lower volume surgeons. Oncologists perform a higher relative percentage of RPs and are significantly more likely to perform LND if performed robotically when compared with general urologists.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel data warehouse based on automated retrieval from an institutional health care information system (HIS) was made available to be compared with a traditional prospectively maintained surgical database. METHODS: A newly established institutional data warehouse at a single-institution academic medical center autopopulated by HIS was queried for International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes for pancreatic neoplasm. Patients with ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for pancreatic neoplasm were captured. A parallel query was performed using a prospective database populated by manual entry. Duplicated patients and those unique to either data set were identified. All patients were manually reviewed to determine the accuracy of diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 1107 patients were identified from the HIS-linked data set with pancreatic neoplasm from 1999-2009. Of these, 254 (22.9%) patients were also captured by the surgical database, whereas 853 (77.1%) patients were only in the HIS-linked data set. Manual review of the HIS-only group demonstrated that 45.0% of patients were without identifiable pancreatic pathology, suggesting erroneous capture, whereas 36.3% of patients were consistent with pancreatic neoplasm and 18.7% with other pancreatic pathology. Of the 394 patients identified by the surgical database, 254 (64.5%) patients were captured by HIS, whereas 140 (35.5%) patients were not. Manual review of patients only captured by the surgical database demonstrated 85.9% with pancreatic neoplasm and 14.1% with other pancreatic pathology. Finally, review of the 254 patient overlap demonstrated that 80.3% of patients had pancreatic neoplasm and 19.7% had other pancreatic pathology. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cautious interpretation of administrative data rely only on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and clinical correlation through previously validated mechanisms.

AB  - The burden of comorbidity in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is substantial. The symptoms of autism overlap with many other human conditions, reflecting common molecular pathologies suggesting that cross-disorder analysis will help prioritize autism gene candidates. Genes in the intersection between autism and related conditions may represent nonspecific indicators of dysregulation while genes unique to autism may play a more causal role. Thorough literature review allowed us to extract 125 ICD-9 codes comorbid to ASD that we mapped to 30 specific human disorders. In the present work, we performed an automated extraction of genes associated with ASD and its comorbid disorders, and found 1031 genes involved in ASD, among which 262 are involved in ASD only, with the remaining 779 involved in ASD and at least one comorbid disorder. A pathway analysis revealed 13 pathways not involved in any other comorbid disorders and therefore unique to ASD, all associated with basal cellular functions. These pathways differ from the pathways associated with both ASD and its comorbid conditions, with the latter being more specific to neural function. To determine whether the sequence of these genes have been subjected to differential evolutionary constraints, we studied long term constraints by looking into Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling, and showed that genes involved in several comorbid disorders seem to have undergone more purifying selection than the genes involved in ASD only. This result was corroborated by a higher dN/dS ratio for genes unique to ASD as compare to those that are shared between ASD and its comorbid disorders. Short-term evolutionary constraints showed the same trend as the pN/pS ratio indicates that genes unique to ASD were under significantly less evolutionary constraint than the genes associated with all other disorders.

AB  - Classification systems such as ICD-10 for diagnoses or the Swiss Operation Classification System (CHOP) for procedure classification in the clinical treatment are essential for clinical management and information exchange. Traditionally, classification codes are assigned manually or by systems that rely upon concept-based or rule-based classification methods. Such methods can reach their limit easily due to the restricted coverage of handcrafted rules and of the vocabulary in underlying terminological systems. Conventional machine learning approaches normally depend on selected features within a human annotated training set. However, it is quite laborious to obtain a well labeled data set and its generation can easily be influenced by accumulative errors caused by human factors. To overcome this, we will present our processing pipeline for query matching realized through neural networks within the task of medical procedure classification. The pipeline is built upon convolutional neural networks (CNN) and autoencoder with logistic regression. On the task of relevance determination between query and category text, the autoencoder based method has achieved a micro F1 score of 70.29%, while the convolutional based method has reached a micro F1 score of 60.86% with high efficiency. These two algorithms are compared in experiments with different configurations and baselines (SVM, logistic regression) with respect to their suitability for the task of automatic encoding. Advantages and limitations are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological data on rare spinal cord malformations in children are lacking in France. Using the national hospital discharge database (PMSI), we studied the care trajectories and estimated the morbidity and mortality burden of these conditions. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a nationwide historical cohort study from 2010 to 2020, including children diagnosed with rare spinal cord diseases within the scope of the C-MAVEM network. Cases were identified through ICD-10 codes using a semi-automated, multicenter-validated extraction algorithm (positive predictive value >80%). Incidence and in-hospital mortality rates were estimated for the following conditions: Spina Bifida (SB), Arnold Chiari syndrome (ACS), Syringomyelia and Syringobulbia (SM), Diastematomyelia (DM), and Hydromyelia (HM). RESULTS: A total of 10,114 children were identified, corresponding to an estimated prevalence of 67 per 100,000. Incidence rates per 100,000 live births were: 2.6 for SB, 2.2 for ACS, 1.0 for SM, 0.2 for DM, and 0.04 for HM. The mortality was 2.5%, 1.7%, 1.1%, 0.95%, no available for HM, respectively. Most patients were treated in university hospitals with considerable heterogeneity in surgical management depending on etiology and associated malformations. CONCLUSION: This study provides, for the first time in France, national epidemiological estimates for rare pediatric spinal cord malformations. The use of a validated medico-administrative data extraction approach enables largescale surveillance of these rare conditions, improves understanding of their healthcare burden, and supports planning for specialized care and public health strategies.

AB  - Driven by the growing importance of situational awareness of bioterrorism threats, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the United States have constructed a joint military capability, called the Biosurveillance Portal (BSP), to enhance biosecurity. As one component of the BSP, we developed the Military Active Real-time Syndromic Surveillance (MARSS) system to detect and track natural and deliberate disease outbreaks. This article describes the ROK military health data infrastructure and explains how syndromic data are derived and made available to epidemiologists. Queries corresponding to 8 syndromes, based on published clinical effects of weaponized pathogens, were used to classify military hospital patient records to form aggregated daily syndromic counts. A set of ICD-10 codes for each syndrome was defined through literature review and expert panel discussion. A study set of time series of national daily counts for each syndrome was extracted from the Defense Medical Statistical Information System between January 1, 2011, and May 31, 2014. A stratified, adjusted cumulative summation algorithm was implemented for each syndrome group to signal alerts prompting investigation. The algorithm was developed by calculating sensitivity to sets of 1,000 artificial outbreak signals randomly injected in the dataset, with each signal injected in a separate trial. Queries and visualizations were adapted from the Suite for Automated Global bioSurveillance. Findings indicated that early warning of outbreaks affecting fewer than 50 patients will require analysis at subnational levels, especially for common syndrome groups. Developing MARSS to improve sensitivity will require modification of underlying syndromic diagnosis codes, engineering to coordinate alerts among subdivisions, and enhanced algorithms. The bioterrorist threat in the Korean peninsula mandates these efforts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rare diseases affect millions worldwide but sometimes face limited research focus individually due to low prevalence. Many rare diseases do not have specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) and Tenth Edition (ICD-10), codes and therefore cannot be reliably extracted from granular fields like "Diagnosis" and "Problem List" entries, which complicates tasks that require identification of patients with these conditions, including clinical trial recruitment and research efforts. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating the extraction of medical information, offering the potential to improve medical research, diagnosis, and management. However, most LLMs lack professional medical knowledge, especially concerning specific rare diseases, and cannot effectively manage rare disease data in its various ontological forms, making it unsuitable for these tasks. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to create an end-to-end system called automated rare disease mining (AutoRD), which automates the extraction of rare disease-related information from medical text, focusing on entities and their relations to other medical concepts, such as signs and symptoms. AutoRD integrates up-to-date ontologies with other structured knowledge and demonstrates superior performance in rare disease extraction tasks. We conducted various experiments to evaluate AutoRD's performance, aiming to surpass common LLMs and traditional methods. METHODS: AutoRD is a pipeline system that involves data preprocessing, entity extraction, relation extraction, entity calibration, and knowledge graph construction. We implemented this system using GPT-4 and medical knowledge graphs developed from the open-source Human Phenotype and Orphanet ontologies, using techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning and prompt engineering. We quantitatively evaluated our system's performance in entity extraction, relation extraction, and knowledge graph construction. The experiment used the well-curated dataset RareDis2023, which contains medical literature focused on rare disease entities and their relations, making it an ideal dataset for training and testing our methodology. RESULTS: On the RareDis2023 dataset, AutoRD achieved an overall entity extraction F1-score of 56.1% and a relation extraction F1-score of 38.6%, marking a 14.4% improvement over the baseline LLM. Notably, the F1-score for rare disease entity extraction reached 83.5%, indicating high precision and recall in identifying rare disease mentions. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating LLMs with medical ontologies in extracting complex rare disease information. CONCLUSIONS: AutoRD is an automated end-to-end system for extracting rare disease information from text to build knowledge graphs, addressing critical limitations of existing LLMs by improving identification of these diseases and connecting them to related clinical features. This work underscores the significant potential of LLMs in transforming health care, particularly in the rare disease domain. By leveraging ontology-enhanced LLMs, AutoRD constructs a robust medical knowledge base that incorporates up-to-date rare disease information, facilitating improved identification of patients and resulting in more inclusive research and trial candidacy efforts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Utilization of laparoscopy (LAP) has been increasing in general surgery for years, and there is currently a rapid increase in the utilization of robotic-assisted surgeries (RAS). This study evaluates trends in the surgical approach utilized in some commonly performed surgeries, the proportion of each approach within the procedures, and the cost of these surgeries based on the surgical approach. METHODS: This is a retrospective study using the Vizient database. The database was queried using ICD-9 codes for colectomy, cholecystectomy, inguinal and ventral hernia repairs, and bariatric surgeries, either open, LAP, or robotically performed. Utilization trends were evaluated between quarters, over a 7-year period, and direct cost was compared between approaches. IBM SPSS v.23.0.0 was used for data analysis, with α = 0.05. RESULTS: 857,468 patients underwent colectomy, cholecystectomy, inguinal and ventral hernia repairs, and bariatric procedures. A significant decrease in open-approach utilization was seen in colectomy (71.8-61.9%), cholecystectomy (35.7-27.1%), and bariatric surgeries (20.1-10.1%), whereas both LAP and RAS utilization increased (p < 0.001). Significant RAS increase was seen in all five procedures: colectomy (0.4-8.0%), cholecystectomy (0.2-1.8%), IHR (19.9-29.4%), VHR (0.2-2.9%), and bariatric (0.6-5.4%), compared to a decrease in LAP (p < 0.001). Surgery cost was significantly higher for open ($14,364), followed by RAS ($11,376) and LAP ($7945), p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic technology is commonly viewed as enabling open procedures to be converted to minimally invasive, a trend not observed in our study. Our trends analysis revealed significant RAS utilization increase from LAP procedures and not from open procedure conversion, although specific surgeon data were not available. RAS were costlier than LAP for all five procedures. The benefits of rapid robot adoption and the forces that are driving these must be examined against a backdrop of burdening an already expensive healthcare system.

AB  - PURPOSE: To our knowledge the reliability of administrative claims codes to report postoperative radical cystectomy complications has not been examined. We compared complications identified by claims data to those abstracted from clinical chart review following radical cystectomy. METHODS: We manually reviewed the charts of 268 patients treated with radical cystectomy between 2014 and 2016 for 30-day complications and queried administrative complication coding using 805 ICD-9/10 codes. Complications were categorized. Using Cohen κ statistics we assessed agreement between the 2 methods of complication reporting for 1 or more postoperative complications overall, categorical complications and complications stratified by the top quartile length of hospital stay and patients who were readmitted. RESULTS: At least 1 or more complications were recorded in 122 patients (45.5%) through manual chart review and 80 (29.9%) were recorded via claim coding data with a concordance rate of κ=0.16, indicating weak agreement. Concordance was generally weak for categorical complication rates (range 0.05 to 0.36). However, when examining only the top length of stay quartile, 1 or more complications were reported in 32 patients (65%) by the manual chart review and in 12 (25%) via coding data with a concordance rate of κ=-0.2. Agreement was weak, similar to the total cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Manual chart review and claim code identification of complications are not highly concordant even when stratified by patients with an extended length of stay, who are known to have more frequent complications. Researchers and administrators should be aware of these differences and exercise caution when interpreting complication reports.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques for pancreatic and liver operations remains ill defined. We sought to compare inpatient outcomes among patients undergoing open versus MIS pancreas and liver operations using a nationally representative cohort. METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for all major pancreatic and hepatic resections performed between 2000 and 2011. Appropriate International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) coding modifiers for laparoscopy and robotic assist were used to categorize procedures as MIS. Demographics, comorbidities, and inpatient outcomes were compared between the open and MIS groups. RESULTS: A total of 65,033 resections were identified (pancreas, n = 36,195 [55.7%]; liver, n = 28,035 [43.1%]; combined pancreas and liver, n = 803 [1.2%]). The overwhelming majority of operations were performed open (n = 62,192, 95.6%), whereas 4.4% (n = 2,841) were MIS. The overall use of MIS increased from 2.3% in 2000 to 7.5% in 2011. Compared with patients undergoing an open operation, MIS patients were older and had a greater incidence of multiple comorbid conditions. After operation, the incidence of complications for MIS (pancreas, 35.4%; liver, 29.5%) was lower than for open (pancreas, 41.6%; liver, 33%) procedures (all P < .05) resulting in a shorter median length of stay (8 vs 7 days; P = .001) as well as a lower in-hospital mortality (5.1% vs 2.8%; P = .001). CONCLUSION: During the last decade, the number of MIS pancreatic and hepatic operations has increased, with nearly 1 in 13 HPB cases now being performed via an MIS approach. Despite MIS patients tending to have more preoperative medical comorbidities, postoperative morbidity, mortality, and duration of stay compared favorably with open surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disorder. Efficient identification of patients may improve chronic management of the disease. Prior studies have shown searching International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) codes alone is inaccurate for identifying patients with CD. In this study, we developed automated classification algorithms leveraging pathology reports and other clinical data in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to refine the subset population preselected using ICD-9 code (579.0). MATERIALS AND METHODS: EHRs were searched for established ICD-9 code (579.0) suggesting CD, based on which an initial identification of cases was obtained. In addition, laboratory results for tissue transglutaminse were extracted. Using natural language processing we analyzed pathology reports from upper endoscopy. Twelve machine learning classifiers using different combinations of variables related to ICD-9 CD status, laboratory result status, and pathology reports were experimented to find the best possible CD classifier. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to assess the results. RESULTS: A total of 1498 patient records were used including 363 confirmed cases and 1135 false positive cases that served as controls. Logistic model based on both clinical and pathology report features produced the best results: Kappa of 0.78, F1 of 0.92, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94, whereas in contrast using ICD-9 only generated poor results: Kappa of 0.28, F1 of 0.75, and AUC of 0.63. CONCLUSION: Our automated classification system presented an efficient and reliable way to improve the performance of CD patient identification.

AB  - Injury data in the paper medical record are often inaccurate or lack adequate specificity to evaluate trauma patient care. To improve the quality of recorded injury data, we are testing a graphical, anatomic-based interface for quick collection of detailed injury information directly from the trauma physician. Navigation and data collection throughout the interface are facilitated by anatomic illustrations, menus, lists, and "dialog boxes". Using a "point and click" method, the user selects a specific anatomic structure (i.e., the spleen) from drawings. Detailed injury information, specific to the selected structure, is then collected from the user in an "intelligent" modal dialog box. The software uses SNOMED III nomenclature to create and store ICD, AIS, and trauma registry codes for each injury. Users can review and print abbreviated and detailed injury information for each patient. This demonstration will walk viewers through the injury collection and review process for injuries to the abdomen. We plan to evaluate the interface for accuracy, speed, user satisfaction and resources expended by comparing it with current methods of data collection and injury coding at our level I trauma facility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying rare disease (RD) patients in electronic health records (EHR) is challenging, as more than 10,000 rare diseases are not typically captured by clinical coding systems. This limits the assessment of clinical outcomes for RD patients. This study introduces a semiautomated approach to map RDs to appropriate codes, that is applicable across various EHR systems. By improving RD patient identification, this method facilitates the analysis of clinical outcomes and disease severity in the RD population. We exemplify this by utilizing large EHR datasets such as those in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) with over 21 million patients. METHODS: We developed a semiautomated workflow to enumerate RD-specific SNOMED-CT and ICD-10 codes, starting with 12,003 GARD IDs mapped to ORPHANET. This process linked RDs to SNOMED-CT and ICD-10 codes, applying exclusion criteria based on group of disorders. We created an extensive list of SNOMED-CT codes with descendants from the OHDSI atlas and performed phenotype filtering, removing irrelevant codes. The final list included 12,081 SNOMED-CT codes and 357 ICD-10 codes for further analysis, enabling the identification and mapping of rare diseases in EHR. RESULTS: Our semiautomated workflow identified 357 RD-specific ICD-10 codes and 12,081 SNOMED-CT codes representing 6,342 RDs which are categorized into 30 Orphanet linearization classes. We exemplify the utility of these codes by performing a preliminary univariate analysis of COVID-19 outcomes in a large cohort of 4,835,718 COVID-19 positive individuals in N3C, of which 404,735 (8.37%) were identified as having preexisting RD. The mortality and hospitalization risk ratios for rare RD classes ranged from 0.23 - 5.28 and 0.93 - 3.13, respectively (p-values <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic and automated workflow enables rapid identification of rare disease patients across diverse EHR systems. We demonstrate its utility by evaluating COVID-19 severity outcomes by rare disease classes in the N3C cohort. These findings support the need for targeted preventive healthcare interventions and highlight the potential for future research on long COVID, COVID-19 reinfection, and other outcomes in the rare disease population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Automated Emergency Department syndromic surveillance systems (ED-SyS) are useful tools in routine surveillance activities and during mass gathering events to rapidly detect public health threats. To improve the existing surveillance infrastructure in a lower-resourced rural/remote setting and enhance monitoring during an upcoming mass gathering event, an automated low-cost and low-resources ED-SyS was developed and validated in Yukon, Canada. METHODS: Syndromes of interest were identified in consultation with the local public health authorities. For each syndrome, case definitions were developed using published resources and expert elicitation. Natural language processing algorithms were then written using Stata LP 15.1 (Texas, USA) to detect syndromic cases from three different fields (e.g., triage notes; chief complaint; discharge diagnosis), comprising of free-text and standardized codes. Validation was conducted using data from 19,082 visits between October 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019. The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) records were used as a reference for the inclusion of International Classification of Disease, 10th edition (ICD-10) diagnosis codes. The automatic identification of cases was then manually validated by two raters and results were used to calculate positive predicted values for each syndrome and identify improvements to the detection algorithms. RESULTS: A daily secure file transfer of Yukon's Meditech ED-Tracker system data and an aberration detection plan was set up. A total of six syndromes were originally identified for the syndromic surveillance system (e.g., Gastrointestinal, Influenza-like-Illness, Mumps, Neurological Infections, Rash, Respiratory), with an additional syndrome added to assist in detecting potential cases of COVID-19. The positive predictive value for the automated detection of each syndrome ranged from 48.8-89.5% to 62.5-94.1% after implementing improvements identified during validation. As expected, no records were flagged for COVID-19 from our validation dataset. CONCLUSIONS: The development and validation of automated ED-SyS in lower-resourced settings can be achieved without sophisticated platforms, intensive resources, time or costs. Validation is an important step for measuring the accuracy of syndromic surveillance, and ensuring it performs adequately in a local context. The use of three different fields and integration of both free-text and structured fields improved case detection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ensuring antibiotics are prescribed only when necessary is crucial for maintaining their effectiveness and is a key focus of public health initiatives worldwide. In cases of sinusitis, among the most common reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in children, healthcare providers must distinguish between bacterial and viral causes based on clinical signs and symptoms. However, due to the overlap between symptoms of acute sinusitis and viral upper respiratory infections, antibiotics are often over-prescribed. OBJECTIVES: Currently, there are no electronic health record (EHR)-based methods, such as lab tests or ICD-10 codes, to retroactively assess the appropriateness of prescriptions for sinusitis, making manual chart reviews the only available method for evaluation, which is time-intensive and not feasible at a large scale. In this study, we propose using natural language processing to automate this assessment. METHODS: We developed, trained, and evaluated generative models to classify the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions in 300 clinical notes from pediatric patients with sinusitis seen at a primary care practice in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia network. We utilized standard prompt engineering techniques, including few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting, to refine an initial prompt. Additionally, we employed Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to train a medium-sized generative model Llama 3 70B-instruct. RESULTS: While parameter-efficient fine-tuning did not enhance performance, the combination of few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting proved beneficial. Our best results were achieved using the largest generative model publicly available to date, the Llama 3.1 405B-instruct. On our evaluation set, the model correctly identified 94.7% of the 152 notes where antibiotic prescription was appropriate and 66.2% of the 83 notes where it was not appropriate. However, 15 notes that were insufficiently, vaguely, or ambiguously documented by physicians posed a challenge to our model, as none were accurately classified. CONCLUSION: Our generative model demonstrated good performance in the challenging task of chart review. This level of performance may be sufficient for deploying the model within the EHR, where it can assist physicians in real-time to prescribe antibiotics in concordance with the guidelines, or for monitoring antibiotic stewardship on a large scale.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no universally accepted algorithm for identifying atrial fibrillation (AF) patients and stroke risk using electronic data for use in performance measures. METHODS: Patients with AF seen in clinic were identified based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision(ICD-9) codes. CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(s)-Vasc scores were derived from a broad, 10-year algorithm using IICD-9 codes dating back 10 years and a restrictive, 1-year algorithm that required a diagnosis within the past year. Accuracy of claims-based AF diagnoses and of each stroke risk classification algorithm were evaluated using chart reviews for 300 patients. These algorithms were applied to assess system-wide anticoagulation rates. RESULTS: Between 6/1/2011, and 5/31/2012, we identified 6,397 patients with AF. Chart reviews confirmed AF or atrial flutter in 95.7%. A 1-year algorithm using CHA(2)DS(2)-Vasc score ≥2 to identify patients at risk for stroke maximized positive predictive value (97.5% [negative predictive value 65.1%]). The PPV of the 10-year algorithm using CHADS(2) was 88.0%; 12% those identified as high-risk had CHADS(2) scores <2. Anticoagulation rates were identical using 1-year and 10-year algorithms for patients with CHADS(2) scores ≥2 (58.5% on anticoagulation) and CHA(2)DS(2)-Vasc scores ≥2 (56.0% on anticoagulation). CONCLUSIONS: Automated methods can be used to identify patients with prevalent AF indicated for anticoagulation but may have misclassification up to 12%, which limits the utility of relying on administrative data alone for quality assessment. Misclassification is minimized by requiring comorbidity diagnoses within the prior year and using a CHA(2)DS(2)-Vasc based algorithm. Despite differences in accuracy between algorithms, system-wide anticoagulation rates assessed were similar regardless of algorithm used.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to use natural language processing (NLP) as a supplement to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and laboratory values in an automated algorithm to better define and risk-stratify patients with cirrhosis. BACKGROUND: Identification of patients with cirrhosis by manual data collection is time-intensive and laborious, whereas using ICD-9 codes can be inaccurate. NLP, a novel computerized approach to analyzing electronic free text, has been used to automatically identify patient cohorts with gastrointestinal pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease. This methodology has not yet been used in cirrhosis. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles Health, an academic medical center. A total of 5343 University of California, Los Angeles primary care patients with ICD-9 codes for chronic liver disease were identified during March 2013 to January 2015. An algorithm incorporating NLP of radiology reports, ICD-9 codes, and laboratory data determined whether these patients had cirrhosis. Of the 5343 patients, 168 patient charts were manually reviewed at random as a gold standard comparison. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity of the algorithm and each of its steps were calculated. RESULTS: The algorithm's PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity were 91.78%, 96.84%, 95.71%, and 93.88%, respectively. The NLP portion was the most important component of the algorithm with PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.44%, 93.27%, 90.00%, and 98.98%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NLP is a powerful tool that can be combined with administrative and laboratory data to identify patients with cirrhosis within a population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hysterectomy is one of the most common procedures performed in the United States. New techniques utilizing laparoscopic and robotic technology are becoming increasingly common. It is unknown if these minimally invasive surgical techniques alter the risk of surgical site infections (SSI). METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy at our institution between January 2011 and June 2013. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth edition (ICD-9) codes and chart review were used to identify patients undergoing hysterectomy by open, laparoscopic, or robotic approach and to identify patients who developed SSI subsequently. Chi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to identify univariate risk factors and logistic regression was used to perform multivariable analysis. RESULTS: During this time period, 986 patients were identified who had undergone abdominal hysterectomy, with 433 receiving open technique (44%), 116 laparoscopic (12%), 407 robotic (41%), and 30 cases that were converted from minimally invasive to open (3%). Patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomy were significantly younger and had lower body mass index (BMI) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores than those undergoing open or robotic hysterectomy. There were no significant differences between patients undergoing open versus robotic hysterectomy. The post-operative hospital stay was significantly longer for open procedures compared with those using laparoscopic or robotic techniques (5.1, 1.7, and 1.6 d, respectively; p<0.0001). The overall rate of SSI after all hysterectomy procedures was 4.2%. More SSI occurred in open cases (6.5%) than laparoscopic (0%) or robotic (2.2%) (p<0.0001). Cases converted to open also had an increased rate of SSI (13.3%). In both univariate and multivariable analyses, open technique, wound class of III/IV, age greater than 75 y, and morbid obesity were all associated with increased risk of SSI. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomies were associated with a significantly lower risk of SSI and shorter hospital stays. Body mass index, advanced age, and wound class were also independent risk factors for SSI.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early detection of disease outbreaks by a medical biosurveillance system relies on two major components: 1) the contribution of early and reliable data sources and 2) the sensitivity, specificity, and timeliness of biosurveillance detection algorithms. This paper describes an effort to assess leading detection algorithms by arranging a common challenge problem and providing a common data set. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine whether automated detection algorithms can reliably and quickly identify the onset of natural disease outbreaks that are surrogates for possible terrorist pathogen releases, and do so at acceptable false-alert rates (e.g., once every 2-6 weeks). METHODS: Historic de-identified data were obtained from five metropolitan areas over 23 months; these data included International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes related to respiratory and gastrointestinal illness syndromes. An outbreak detection group identified and labeled two natural disease outbreaks in these data and provided them to analysts for training of detection algorithms. All outbreaks in the remaining test data were identified but not revealed to the detection groups until after their analyses. The algorithms established a probability of outbreak for each day's counts. The probability of outbreak was assessed as an "actual" alert for different false-alert rates. RESULTS: The best algorithms were able to detect all of the outbreaks at false-alert rates of one every 2-6 weeks. They were often able to detect for the same day human investigators had identified as the true start of the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Because minimal data exists for an actual biologic attack, determining how quickly an algorithm might detect such an attack is difficult. However, application of these algorithms in combination with other data-analysis methods to historic outbreak data indicates that biosurveillance techniques for analyzing syndrome counts can rapidly detect seasonal respiratory and gastrointestinal illness outbreaks. Further research is needed to assess the value of electronic data sources for predictive detection. In addition, simulations need to be developed and implemented to better characterize the size and type of biologic attack that can be detected by current methods by challenging them under different projected operational conditions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this study, we investigate the evolution of lumbar fusion surgery with robotic assistance, specifically focusing on the impact of robotic technology on pedicle screw placement and fixation. Utilizing data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) covering 2016 to 2019, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of postoperative outcomes and costs for single-level lumbar fusion surgery. Traditionally, freehand techniques for pedicle screw placement posed risks, leading to the development of robotic-assisted techniques with advantages such as reduced misplacement, increased precision, smaller incisions, and decreased surgeon fatigue. However, conflicting study results regarding the efficacy of robotic assistance in comparison to conventional techniques have prompted the need for a thorough evaluation. With a dataset of 461,965 patients, our aim is to provide insights into the impact of robotic assistance on patient care and healthcare resource utilization. Our primary goal is to contribute to the ongoing discourse on the efficacy of robotic technology in lumbar fusion procedures, offering meaningful insights for optimizing patient-centered care and healthcare resource allocation. METHODS: This study employed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) spanning the years 2016 to 2019 from USA, 461,965 patients underwent one-level lumbar fusion surgery, with 5770 of them having the surgery with the assistance of robotic technology. The study focused primarily on one-level lumbar fusion surgery and excluded non-elective cases and those with prior surgeries. The analysis encompassed the identification of comorbidities, surgical etiologies, and complications using specific ICD-10 codes. Throughout the study, a constant comparison was made between robotic and non-robotic lumbar fusion procedures. Various statistical methods were applied, with a p value threshold of < 0.05, to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: Robotic-assisted lumbar fusion surgeries demonstrated a significant increase from 2016 to 2019, comprising 1.25% of cases. Both groups exhibited similar patient demographics, with minor differences in payment methods, favoring Medicare in non-robotic surgery and more private payer usage in robotic surgery. A comparison of comorbid conditions revealed differences in the prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and sleep apnea diagnoses-In terms of hospitalization outcomes and costs, there was a slight shorter hospital stay of 3.06 days, compared to 3.13 days in non-robotic surgery, showcasing a statistically significant difference (p = 0.042). Robotic surgery has higher charges, with a mean charge of $154,673, whereas non-robotic surgery had a mean charge of $125,467 (p < 0.0001). Robotic surgery demonstrated lower rates of heart failure, acute coronary artery disease, pulmonary edema, venous thromboembolism, and traumatic spinal injury compared to non-robotic surgery, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Conversely, robotic surgery demonstrated increased post-surgery anemia and blood transfusion requirements compared to non-robotic patients (p < 0.0001). Renal disease prevalence was similar before surgery, but acute kidney injury was slightly higher in the robotic group post-surgery (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: This is the first big data study on this matter, our study showed that Robotic-assisted lumbar fusion surgery has fewer post-operative complications such as heart failure, acute coronary artery disease, pulmonary edema, venous thromboembolism, and traumatic spinal injury in comparison to conventional methods. Conversely, robotic surgery demonstrated increased post-surgery anemia, blood transfusion and acute kidney injury. Robotic surgery has higher charges compared to non-robotic surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate and scalable surveillance methods are critical to understand widespread problems associated with misuse and abuse of prescription opioids and for implementing effective prevention and control measures. Traditional diagnostic coding incompletely documents problem use. Relevant information for each patient is often obscured in vast amounts of clinical text. OBJECTIVES: We developed and evaluated a method that combines natural language processing (NLP) and computer-assisted manual review of clinical notes to identify evidence of problem opioid use in electronic health records (EHRs). METHODS: We used the EHR data and text of 22,142 patients receiving chronic opioid therapy (≥70 days' supply of opioids per calendar quarter) during 2006-2012 to develop and evaluate an NLP-based surveillance method and compare it to traditional methods based on International Classification of Disease, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) codes. We developed a 1288-term dictionary for clinician mentions of opioid addiction, abuse, misuse or overuse, and an NLP system to identify these mentions in unstructured text. The system distinguished affirmative mentions from those that were negated or otherwise qualified. We applied this system to 7336,445 electronic chart notes of the 22,142 patients. Trained abstractors using a custom computer-assisted software interface manually reviewed 7751 chart notes (from 3156 patients) selected by the NLP system and classified each note as to whether or not it contained textual evidence of problem opioid use. RESULTS: Traditional diagnostic codes for problem opioid use were found for 2240 (10.1%) patients. NLP-assisted manual review identified an additional 728 (3.1%) patients with evidence of clinically diagnosed problem opioid use in clinical notes. Inter-rater reliability among pairs of abstractors reviewing notes was high, with kappa=0.86 and 97% agreement for one pair, and kappa=0.71 and 88% agreement for another pair. CONCLUSIONS: Scalable, semi-automated NLP methods can efficiently and accurately identify evidence of problem opioid use in vast amounts of EHR text. Incorporating such methods into surveillance efforts may increase prevalence estimates by as much as one-third relative to traditional methods.

AB  - AIM: To describe the annual incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among women beneficiaries of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) in Mexico from 2008 to 2023. METHODS: Data from the IMSS's Institutional Automated System for Epidemiological Surveillance (SIAVE) from 2008 to 2023 were used. GDM cases during pregnancy were identified using ICD-10 O24.4 diagnostic codes. Changes in annual incidence were evaluated using the Join-Point program version 5.1.0 to calculate the annual percentage change (APC) and the average annual percentage change (AAPC). RESULTS: A total of 103,749 cases of diabetes during pregnancy were recorded and the annual incidence rate of GDM increased over the time. The incidence of GDM peaked in 2021 among those 19 years old or younger, and in 2022 among those 20 years old or older, with a higher incidence in the latter group. There was a considerably higher incidence of GDM in the North region compared to the other regions. The estimated AAPC for the 2008-2023 period was 21.1 (16.8-25.6) per 1000 live births, and was higher in the West region. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a nationwide substantial upward trend in GDM incidence between 2008 and 2023. Both teenage and adult women reported a higher incidence in recent years (2021 and 2022, respectively). The North region had the highest incidence, while the West had the highest AAPC.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: While the penetrance of robotic surgery into field of urology and gynecology has been significant, general surgeons have been slower adopters. We sought to compare laparoscopy and RAS among five different general surgical procedures with various penetrance of MIS. METHODS: Following IRB approval, the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System administrative data were used to identify five common laparoscopic general surgery procedures: cholecystectomy, colectomy, esophageal fundoplication (EF), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) between 2008 and 2012. ICD-9 codes were used to select laparoscopic versus robotic procedures. Procedures were compared based on any complication and hospital length of stay (HLOS). Following descriptive analysis, propensity score analysis was used to estimate the population average differences between patients who underwent robotic-assisted and laparoscopic procedures. RESULTS: There were 1458 patients who had undergone robotic-assisted surgery and 166,790 patients who had undergone laparoscopic surgery among the five procedures between 2008 and 2012. Of the 1458 robotic cases, 186 were cholecystectomy, 307 were RYGB, 118 were SG, 288 were EF, and 559 were colectomy. Initial univariate analysis showed a significantly higher rate of overall complications and HLOS in the laparoscopic group compared to the robotic-assisted group. Laparoscopic colectomy had a significantly higher rate of complications and longer length of stay compared to robotic approaches. No difference in complications or HLOS was seen in the cholecystectomy group. Following propensity score analysis, patients who had undergone robotic-assisted colectomy had significantly lower rate of complications compared to those who underwent conventional laparoscopic procedure (p value = 0.0022). In addition, patients who underwent robotic-assisted SG had on average 1.22 days longer HLOS (p value = 0.0037). CONCLUSION: Robotic approaches may facilitate safer adoption of minimally invasive approaches in areas where penetrance of conventional laparoscopy is low, such as in colorectal surgery.

AB  - Accurate, automated extraction of clinical stroke information from unstructured text has several important applications. ICD-9/10 codes can misclassify ischemic stroke events and do not distinguish acuity or location. Expeditious, accurate data extraction could provide considerable improvement in identifying stroke in large datasets, triaging critical clinical reports, and quality improvement efforts. In this study, we developed and report a comprehensive framework studying the performance of simple and complex stroke-specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) methods to determine presence, location, and acuity of ischemic stroke from radiographic text. We collected 60,564 Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiology reports from 17,864 patients from two large academic medical centers. We used standard techniques to featurize unstructured text and developed neurovascular specific word GloVe embeddings. We trained various binary classification algorithms to identify stroke presence, location, and acuity using 75% of 1,359 expert-labeled reports. We validated our methods internally on the remaining 25% of reports and externally on 500 radiology reports from an entirely separate academic institution. In our internal population, GloVe word embeddings paired with deep learning (Recurrent Neural Networks) had the best discrimination of all methods for our three tasks (AUCs of 0.96, 0.98, 0.93 respectively). Simpler NLP approaches (Bag of Words) performed best with interpretable algorithms (Logistic Regression) for identifying ischemic stroke (AUC of 0.95), MCA location (AUC 0.96), and acuity (AUC of 0.90). Similarly, GloVe and Recurrent Neural Networks (AUC 0.92, 0.89, 0.93) generalized better in our external test set than BOW and Logistic Regression for stroke presence, location and acuity, respectively (AUC 0.89, 0.86, 0.80). Our study demonstrates a comprehensive assessment of NLP techniques for unstructured radiographic text. Our findings are suggestive that NLP/ML methods can be used to discriminate stroke features from large data cohorts for both clinical and research-related investigations.

AB  - The development in the United States of America of an automated system for coding mortality data (Automated Classification of Medical Entities--ACME) was undertaken with two major objectives in mind: (i) to introduce consistent and rapid assignment of underlying cause-of-death coding with reduced needs for manpower training; and (ii) to allow better utilization of medical information on death certificates for multiple cause-of-death analyses. The ACME system meets both of these objectives; the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) produces all of its underlying cause-of-death statistics for the United States on the basis of this system, and multiple cause-of-death data are routinely available for additional epidemiological study beyond the traditional methods of vital statistics analyses. Enhancements of the automated system, primarily through the software known as MICAR, reduce even further the levels of training necessary for persons doing the basic data entry. MICAR additionally will ease transitions between ICD revisions by reducing the need for coder reorientation and by permitting rapid calculation of comparability ratios when new revisions are introduced.

AB  - Coding accuracy in case-mix databases enables efficient funding of health facilities and accurate epidemiological statistics based on patients' stays information. We assume that the data collected in the electronic health record, especially drug prescriptions and medical reports are relevant for checking the consistency of the coding of diagnoses. We evaluated a new coding control tool, "TOLBIAC control", embedded in the Web100T coding assistant. This tool interacts with the Vidal Application Programming Interface and the electronic health record of the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne. The micro-average F-measure was 0.76 for drug prescriptions and 0.55 for free text medical reports. This initial evaluation has revealed that drug prescriptions in EHRs can successfully be used to develop an automated ICD-10 code-control tool. Nevertheless the "TOLBIAC control" tool is not yet fully effective for widespread use because of its limited performance in text analysis, a feature that is currently undergoing improvements.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Improved recognition of the importance of systolic blood pressure (SBP) has been identified as one of the major public health and medical challenges in the prevention and treatment of hypertension (HTN). SBP is a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease but no information is available on whether patients understand the importance of their SBP level. The purpose of this study was to assess HTN knowledge, awareness, and attitudes, especially related to SBP in a hypertensive population. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: We identified patients with HTN (N=2,264) in the primary care setting of a large midwestern health system using automated claims data (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] codes 401.0-401.9). We randomly selected 1,250 patients and, after excluding ineligible patients, report the results on 826 completed patient telephone interviews (72% response rate [826/1,151]). MAIN RESULTS: Ninety percent of hypertensive patients knew that lowering blood pressure (BP) would improve health and 91% reported that a health care provider had told them that they have HTN or high BP. However, 41% of patients did not know their BP level. Eighty-two percent of all patients correctly identified the meaning of HTN as "high blood pressure." Thirty-four percent of patients correctly identified SBP as the "top" number of their reading; 32% correctly identified diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as the "bottom" number; and, overall, only 30% of patients were able to correctly identify both systolic and diastolic BP measures. Twenty-seven percent of patients with elevated SBP and DBP (as indicated by their medical records) perceived that their BP was high. Twenty-four percent of patients did not know the optimal level for either SBP or DBP. When asked whether the DBP or SBP level was more important in the control and prevention of disease, 41% reported DBP, 13% reported SBP, 30% reported that both were important, and 17% did not know. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, although general knowledge and awareness of HTN is adequate, patients do not have a comprehensive understanding of this condition. For instance, patients do not recognize the importance of elevated SBP levels or the current status of their BP control. An opportunity exists to focus patient education programs and interventions on the cardiovascular risk associated with uncontrolled HTN, particularly elevated SBP levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe usage of the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) during mandated waiting periods following myocardial infarction (MI) for patients perceived to be at high risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). BACKGROUND: Current device guidelines and insurance coverage require waiting periods of either 40 days or 3 months before implanting a cardioverter-defibrillator post-myocardial infarction (MI), depending on whether or not acute revascularization was undertaken. METHODS: We assessed characteristics of and outcomes for patients who had a WCD prescribed in the first 3 months post-MI. The WCD medical order registry was searched for patients who were coded as having had a "recent MI with ejection fraction ≤35%" or given an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision 410.xx diagnostic code (acute MI), and then matched to device-recorded data. RESULTS: Between September 2005 and July 2011, 8,453 unique patients (age 62.7 ± 12.7 years, 73% male) matched study criteria. A total of 133 patients (1.6%) received 309 appropriate shocks. Of these patients, 91% were resuscitated from a ventricular arrhythmia. For shocked patients, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was ≤30% in 106, 30% to 35% in 17, >36% in 8, and not reported in 2 patients. Of the 38% of patients not revascularized, 84% had a LVEF ≤30%; of the 62% of patients revascularized, 77% had a LVEF ≤30%. The median time from the index MI to WCD therapy was 16 days. Of the treated patients, 75% received treatment in the first month, and 96% within the first 3 months of use. Shock success resulting in survival was 84% in nonrevascularized and 95% in revascularized patients. CONCLUSIONS: During the 40-day and 3-month waiting periods in patients post-MI, the WCD successfully treated SCA in 1.4%, and the risk was highest in the first month of WCD use. The WCD may benefit individual patients selected for high risk of SCA early post-MI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interoperable phenotyping algorithms, needed to identify patient cohorts meeting eligibility criteria for observational studies or clinical trials, require medical data in a consistent structured, coded format. Data heterogeneity limits such algorithms' applicability. Existing approaches are often: not widely interoperable; or, have low sensitivity due to reliance on the lowest common denominator (ICD-9 diagnoses). In the Scalable Collaborative Infrastructure for a Learning Healthcare System (SCILHS) we endeavor to use the widely-available Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) procedure codes with ICD-9. Unfortunately, CPT changes drastically year-to-year - codes are retired/replaced. Longitudinal analysis requires grouping retired and current codes. BioPortal provides a navigable CPT hierarchy, which we imported into the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) data warehouse and analytics platform. However, this hierarchy does not include retired codes. METHODS: We compared BioPortal's 2014AA CPT hierarchy with Partners Healthcare's SCILHS datamart, comprising three-million patients' data over 15 years. 573 CPT codes were not present in 2014AA (6.5 million occurrences). No existing terminology provided hierarchical linkages for these missing codes, so we developed a method that automatically places missing codes in the most specific "grouper" category, using the numerical similarity of CPT codes. Two informaticians reviewed the results. We incorporated the final table into our i2b2 SCILHS/PCORnet ontology, deployed it at seven sites, and performed a gap analysis and an evaluation against several phenotyping algorithms. RESULTS: The reviewers found the method placed the code correctly with 97 % precision when considering only miscategorizations ("correctness precision") and 52 % precision using a gold-standard of optimal placement ("optimality precision"). High correctness precision meant that codes were placed in a reasonable hierarchal position that a reviewer can quickly validate. Lower optimality precision meant that codes were not often placed in the optimal hierarchical subfolder. The seven sites encountered few occurrences of codes outside our ontology, 93 % of which comprised just four codes. Our hierarchical approach correctly grouped retired and non-retired codes in most cases and extended the temporal reach of several important phenotyping algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simple, easily-validated, automated method to place retired CPT codes into the BioPortal CPT hierarchy. This complements existing hierarchical terminologies, which do not include retired codes. The approach's utility is confirmed by the high correctness precision and successful grouping of retired with non-retired codes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Congenital heart disease (CHD) patients with single ventricle physiology (SVP) have heterogeneous characteristics that challenge cohort classification. We aim to develop a phenotyping algorithm that accurately identifies SVP patients using electronic health record (EHR) data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for initial classification, then enhanced the algorithm with domain expertise, imaging reports, and progress notes. The algorithm was developed using a cohort of 1020 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans and tested in a separate cohort of 2500 CHD patients with adjudication. Validation was performed in a holdout group of 22 500 CHD patients. We evaluated performance using accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F1 score, and compared it to a published algorithm for SVP using the same dataset. RESULTS: In the 2500-testing cohort, our algorithm based on specialty-defined features and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes achieved 99.24% accuracy, 94.12% precision, 85.11% sensitivity, and 89.39% F1 score. In contrast, the published method achieved 95.20% accuracy, 43.23% precision, 88.30% sensitivity, and 58.04% F1 score. In the 22 500-validation cohort, our algorithm achieved 93.82% precision, while the published method achieved 43.00%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our automated phenotype algorithm, combined with physician adjudication, outperforms a published method for SVP classification. It effectively identifies false positives by cross-referencing clinical notes and detects missed SVP cases that were due to absent or erroneous ICD codes. Our integrated phenotyping algorithm showed excellent performance and has the potential to improve research and clinical care of SVP patients through the automated development of an electronic cohort for prognostication, monitoring, and management.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Organized screening programs automate fecal immunochemical test (FIT) outreach based on chronological age. However, providers and patients may defer screening due to coexisting conditions, which can be captured by International Classification of Disease, 10 METHODS: We included screen-eligible patients with a primary care visit between June 2022 and June 2023. We enumerated and compared the frequency of each ICD-10 code between patients with and without a FIT ordered. We conducted a subgroup analysis including only those with a Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) <5. RESULTS: We identified 15,020 screen-eligible patients, with 10,187 (67.8%) patients having had a FIT order and 4,833 (32.3%) patients without a FIT order. Of the 1,215 ICD-10 codes examined, 96 were significantly associated with not having a FIT order. One broad category of codes pertained to digestive diseases such as benign and malignant colonic neoplasms (ICD-10 code C18, odds ratio (OR) 0.06, 95% CI [0.001-0.44]) and diverticular disease (K57, OR 0.26 [0.18-0.36]). Another category was comorbid conditions which included frailty (R54, OR 0.14 [0.03-0.55]) and paralysis (G82, OR 0.14 [0.03-0.55]). Those with acute conditions such as cervical fractures (S12, OR 0.23 [0.10-0.48]) and cryptococcosis (B45, OR 0.05 [0.001-0.38]) were also less likely to have a FIT order. Among the patients with CCI<5, 41 codes were significantly associated with not having a FIT order, including heart failure (I50, OR 0.55 [0.43-0.71]) and chronic kidney disease (N18, OR 0.58 [0.43-0.77]). CONCLUSION: Patients deferred from screening were more likely to have ICD-10 codes signifying digestive diseases, comorbidities, and acute conditions. Even among patients with fewer co-morbid conditions, we identified health conditions that were associated with screening deferral. Future work should consider whether screening programs could incorporate ICD-10 codes to align FIT outreach more closely with provider and patient preferences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Robotic technology shows some promising early outcomes indicating potentially improved outcomes particularly for challenging bariatric procedures. Still, health care providers face significant clinical and economic challenges when introducing innovations. METHODS: Prospectively derived administrative cost data of patients who were coded with a primary diagnosis of obesity (ICD-10 code E.66.X), a procedure of gastric bypass surgery (CHOP code 44.3), and a robotic identifier (CHOP codes 00.90.50 or 00.39) during the years 2012 to 2015 was analyzed and compared to the triggered reimbursement for this patient cohort. RESULTS: A total of 348 patients were identified. The mean number of diagnoses was 2.7 and the mean length of stay was 5.9 days. The overall mean cost per patients was Swiss Francs (CHF) from 2012 to 2014 that was 21,527, with a mean reimbursement of CHF 24,917. Cost of the surgery in 2015 was comparable to the previous years with CHF 22,550.0 (p = 0.6618), but reimbursement decreased significantly to CHF 20,499.0 (0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The average cost for robotic gastric bypass surgery fell well below the average reimbursement within the Swiss DRG system between 2012 and 2014, and this robotic procedure was a DRG winner for that period. However, the Swiss DRG system has matured over the years with a significant decrease resulting in a deficit for robotic gastric bypass surgery in 2015. This stipulates a discussion as to how health care providers should continue offering robotic gastric bypass surgery, particularly in the light of developing clinical evidence.

AB  - Every time the classification of causes of death is changed, time series of deaths by cause are disrupted in more or less profound ways. When changes involve only the merging of several items or splitting a single item into several new categories, the problems caused by these ruptures are not too difficult to solve. A more or less severe imbroglio occurs, however, each time a new item results from recombining portions of different split items. Sometimes, but very rarely, some countries proceed to a bridge coding during the year of transition, which can help reconstruct coherent time series. This article first summarizes the general principles of the method developed for France by Meslé and Vallin to reconstruct complete series for France from 1925 to 1999 in the detailed list of the 9th WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD), doing so by successively bridging a posteriori the five versions of the ICD that were in use during that period. Second, it reports on several methodological improvements that have been developed with the aim to reconstruct and analyze mortality trends by cause in sixteen industrialized countries.

AB  - We propose to design and test an information-processing model to participate in appraising the quality and the consistency of the coding, for billing, of Standardized Discharge Summaries (SDSs). We designed a model using both symbolic knowledge extracted from the NLM's UMLS and statistical knowledge. The aim is to retrieve from the ICD-10 terms recorded in a SDS the Principal Diagnosis (PD) at the time of coding. In 90% of cases the PD was retrieved 1st or 2nd in SDS including three ICD-10 codes or more. This model could contribute as part of an automated quality control process in a hospital information system by checking consistency in coded SDSs and improve the income of the hospital.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of a software tool integrated into the medical electronic history at the time of emergency triage. The aim was the early detection of patients with severe sepsis, and the potential impact of this software tool on reducing the mortality rate in patients treated. METHOD: The study consisted of two comparative samples. Patient selection was performed retrospectively into two groups using ICD-9 codes from the hospital and emergency department discharge reports. The codes were 038.9, 995.9 and 995.92 for sepsis, and 785.52 for severe sepsis and septic shock. The sample called «alarms» consisted of patients studied after implementing the sepsis alarm system in the Emergency Department computer system. There were two types of alarms, a serious one and an alert one depending on the on vital signs defined. The historical sample called «no alarms» consisted of patients seen in the Emergency Department during the year before the introduction of the alarm system. RESULTS: The compliance rate of the sepsis treatment package was higher in the «alarms» sample, compared to the sample without alarms, with blood cultures, 96.3% versus 80.9% (P<.001), antibiotic treatment in less than one hour, 62.9% vs. 39.3% (P<.001), determination of lactic acid, 91.4% vs. 77.9% (P<.001), and applying appropriate volume, 57.7% vs 54.3% (P=.052), respectively. The hospital mortality was reduced in absolute terms from 25% in the sample without alarms to 13.6% in the sample with alarms. Survival at 30 days was higher in the sample with alarms (Log Rank=.004). CONCLUSIONS: There were no studies that evaluated the effectiveness of an alarm system in our literature search. An electronic identification system for patients with sepsis allows acting earlier, better compliance with basic measures, and a reduction in hospital stay and mortality.

AB  - Endoscopic interventions are essential for diagnosing and treating gastrointestinal conditions. Accurate and comprehensive documentation is crucial for enhancing patient safety and optimizing clinical outcomes; however, adverse events remain underreported. This study evaluates a machine learning-based approach for systematically detecting endoscopic adverse events from real-world clinical metadata, including structured hospital data such as ICD-codes and procedure timings. Using a random forest classifier detecting adverse events perforation, bleeding, and readmission, we analysed 2490 inpatient cases, achieving significant improvements over baseline prediction accuracy. The model achieved AUC-ROC/AUC-PR values of 0.9/0.69 for perforation, 0.84/0.64 for bleeding, and 0.96/0.9 for readmissions. Results highlight the importance of multiple metadata features for robust predictions. This semi-automated method offers a privacy-preserving tool for identifying documentation discrepancies and enhancing quality control. By integrating metadata analysis, this approach supports better clinical decision-making, quality improvement initiatives, and resource allocation while reducing the risk of missed adverse events in endoscopy.

AB  - Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an analog of chloroquine, is widely used in various rheumatologic and dermatologic disorders. However, it may cause severe retinopathy with long-term use. The guidelines proposed by the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggested a baseline fundus examination and an annual screening after 5 years by using automated visual fields (VF) plus spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Both multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) can also be used to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to examine if the current HCQ screening practice in Taiwan was sufficient according to the guidelines to prevent severe macular complications.This study could remind every doctor to explain visual side effects thoroughly to every patient using HCQ, and refer patients for the ophthalmologic survey to eliminate potential visual impairment caused by this medicine.This nationwide population-based cohort study included all patients who started taking HCQ (n = 5826) from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2007, in the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. The ICD codes used for HCQ retinopathy were 362.10, 362.55, 362.89, and 362.9. Patients previously diagnosed these retinal disorders were excluded. Demographic data including sex, age, diagnostic tools used, and the date of the initial diagnosis of the subsequent HCQ-related retinal disorder were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The patients taking HCQ <5 years were defined as group 1, and >5 years as group 2. The risk of developing retinal diseases between these 2 groups was compared with a 2-sample t-test for continuous variables, and Fisher's exact test for discrete variables. Multiple logistic regressions were used for odds ratio calculation.The baseline examination ratio of the automated VF, SD-OCT scans, and multifocal electroretinograms (mfERGs) in the first 3 months were only 0.2% in both groups. The screening ratio of the 3 examination tools after 5 years were 1.1% in group 1 and 1.2% in group 2. 2.5% and 3.9% of patients developed a retinal disorder after HCQ use in group 1 and 2, respectively. The risk of developing retinal disorder was significantly higher in group 2 (relative risk = 1.53, P = .006). The odds ratio (OR) was also significantly higher in group 2 (1.67 with 95% cumulative incidence 1.20-2.30)The examination ratio according to the guidelines was very low in Taiwan. Thus, it is very important for doctors who prescribe HCQ to schedule both baseline and annual ophthalmology screening tests and inform patients of possible severe ocular complications, even in the patient taking HCQ <5 years. It is also important for ophthalmologists to review medical history carefully to find out the causes of retinotoxicity. Medications should be stopped, if possible when toxicity is recognized or strongly suspected.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Syndromic surveillance is designed for early detection of disease outbreaks. An important data source for syndromic surveillance is free-text chief complaints (CCs), which are generally recorded in the local language. For automated syndromic surveillance, CCs must be classified into predefined syndromic categories. The n-gram classifier is created by using text fragments to measure associations between chief complaints (CC) and a syndromic grouping of ICD codes. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to create a Turkish n-gram CC classifier for the respiratory syndrome and then compare daily volumes between the n-gram CC classifier and a respiratory ICD-10 code grouping on a test set of data. METHODS: The design was a feasibility study based on retrospective cohort data. The setting was a university hospital emergency department (ED) in Turkey. Included were all ED visits in the 2002 database of this hospital. Two of the authors created a respiratory grouping of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision ICD-10-CM codes by consensus, chosen to be similar to a standard respiratory (RESP) grouping of ICD codes created by the Electronic Surveillance System for Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE), a project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An n-gram method adapted from AT&T Labs' technologies was applied to the first 10 months of data as a training set to create a Turkish CC RESP classifier. The classifier was then tested on the subsequent 2 months of visits to generate a time series graph and determine the correlation with daily volumes measured by the CC classifier versus the RESP ICD-10 grouping. RESULTS: The Turkish ED database contained 30,157 visits. The correlation (R (2)) of n-gram versus ICD-10 for the test set was 0.78. CONCLUSION: The n-gram method automatically created a CC RESP classifier of the Turkish CCs that performed similarly to the ICD-10 RESP grouping. The n-gram technique has the advantage of systematic, consistent, and rapid deployment as well as language independence.

AB  - Twenty-six million Americans are estimated to have chronic kidney disease (CKD) with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and end stage renal disease. CKD is frequently undiagnosed and patients are unaware, hampering intervention. A tool for accurate and timely identification of CKD from electronic medical records (EMR) could improve healthcare quality and identify patients for research. As members of eMERGE (electronic medical records and genomics) Network, we developed an automated phenotyping algorithm that can be deployed to identify rapidly diabetic and/or hypertensive CKD cases and controls in health systems with EMRs It uses diagnostic codes, laboratory results, medication and blood pressure records, and textual information culled from notes. Validation statistics demonstrated positive predictive values of 96% and negative predictive values of 93.3. Similar results were obtained on implementation by two independent eMERGE member institutions. The algorithm dramatically outperformed identification by ICD-9-CM codes with 63% positive and 54% negative predictive values, respectively.

AB  - PURPOSE: Underuse of partial vs radical nephrectomy for renal tumors was noted in recent population based analyses. An explanation is the learning curve associated with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. We analyzed state trends in renal surgery and their relationship to the introduction of robotic technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Maryland HSCRC (Health Services Cost Review Commission) database to identify patients who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy, or renal ablation from 2000 to 2011. Utilization trends, and associated patient and hospital factors were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. ICD-9 robotic modifier codes were established in October 2008. RESULTS: Of the 14,260 patients included in analysis 11,271 (79.0%), 2,622 (18.4%) and 367 (2.6%) underwent radical and partial nephrectomy, and renal ablation, respectively. Partial nephrectomy increased from 8.6% in 2000 to 27% in 2011. Open radical nephrectomy decreased by 33%, while minimally invasive radical nephrectomy increased by 15%. Robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy increased from 2008 to 2011, attaining a 14% rate at university and 10% at nonuniversity hospitals (p = 0.03). It was associated with increased partial nephrectomy (OR 9.67, p <0.001). Younger age, male gender and low patient complexity predicted partial nephrectomy on overall analysis, while higher hospital volume and university status were predictors only in earlier years. CONCLUSIONS: Partial nephrectomy use increased in Maryland from 2001 to 2011, which was facilitated by robotic technology. Associations with hospital factors decreased with time. These data suggest that robotic technology may enable surgeons across practice settings to more frequently perform nephron sparing surgery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Deployment-limiting medical conditions are the primary reason why service members are not medically ready. Service-specific standards guide clinicians in what conditions are restrictive for duty, fitness, and/or deployment requirements. The Air Force (AF) codifies most standards in the Medical Standards Directory (MSD). Providers manually search this document, among others, to determine if any standards are violated, a tedious and error-prone process. Digitized, standards-based decision-support tools for providers would ease this workflow. This study digitized and mapped all AF occupations to MSD occupational classes and all MSD standards to diagnosis codes and created and validated a readiness decision support system (RDSS) around this mapping. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A medical coder mapped all standards within the May 2018 v2 MSD to 2018 International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes. For the publication of new MSDs, we devised an automated update process using Amazon Web Service's Comprehend Medical and the Unified Medical Language System's Metathesaurus. We mapped Air Force Specialty Codes to occupational classes using the MSD and AF classification directories. We uploaded this mapping to a cloud-based MySQL (v5.7.23) database and built a web application to interface with it using R (v3.5+). For validation, we compared the RDSS to the record review of two subject-matter experts (SMEs) for 200 outpatient encounters in calendar year 2018. We performed four separate analyses: (1) SME vs. RDSS for any restriction; (2) SME interrater reliability for any restriction; (3) SME vs. RDSS for specific restriction(s); and (4) SME interrater reliability for categorical restriction(s). This study was approved as "Not Human Subjects Research" by the Air Force Research Laboratory (FWR20190100N) and Boston Children's Hospital (IRB-P00031397) review boards. RESULTS: Of the 709 current medical standards in the September 2019 MSD, 631 (89.0%) were mapped to ICD-10-CM codes. These 631 standards mapped to 42,810 unique ICD codes (59.5% of all active 2019 codes) and covered 72.3% (7,823/10,821) of the diagnoses listed on AF profiles and 92.8% of profile days (90.7/97.8 million) between February 1, 2007 and January 31, 2017. The RDSS identified diagnoses warranting any restrictions with 90.8% and 90.0% sensitivity compared to SME A and B. For specific restrictions, the sensitivity was 85.0% and 44.8%. The specificity was poor for any restrictions (20.5%-43.4%) and near perfect for specific restrictions (99.5+%). The interrater reliability between SMEs for all comparisons ranged from minimal to moderate (κ = 0.33-0.61). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated key pilot steps to digitizing and mapping AF readiness standards to existing terminologies. The RDSS showed one potential application. The sensitivity between the SMEs and RDSS demonstrated its viability as a screening tool with further refinement and study. However, its performance was not evenly distributed by special duty status or for the indication of specific restrictions. With machine consumable medical standards integrated within existing digital infrastructure and clinical workflows, RDSSs would remove a significant administrative burden from providers and likely improve the accuracy of readiness metrics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of big data and machine learning within clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) has the potential to transform medicine through better prognosis, diagnosis and automation of tasks. Real-time application of machine learning algorithms, however, is dependent on data being present and entered prior to, or at the point of, CDSS deployment. Our aim was to determine the feasibility of automating CDSSs within electronic health records (EHRs) by investigating the timing, data categorization, and completeness of documentation of their individual components of two common Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) in the Emergency Department. METHODS: The CURB-65 severity score and HEART score were randomly selected from a list of the top emergency medicine CDRs. Emergency department (ED) visits with ICD-9 codes applicable to our CDRs were eligible. The charts were reviewed to determine the categorization components of the CDRs as structured and/or unstructured, median times of documentation, portion of charts with all data components documented as structured data, portion of charts with all structured CDR components documented before ED departure. A kappa score was calculated for interrater reliability. RESULTS: The components of the CDRs were mainly documented as structured data for the CURB-65 severity score and HEART score. In the CURB-65 group, 26.8% of charts had all components documented as structured data, and 67.8% in the HEART score. Documentation of some CDR components often occurred late for both CDRs. Only 21 and 11% of patients had all CDR components documented as structured data prior to ED departure for the CURB-65 and HEART score groups, respectively. The interrater reliability for the CURB-65 score review was 0.75 and 0.65 for the HEART score. CONCLUSION: Our study found that EHRs may be unable to automatically calculate popular CDRs-such as the CURB-65 severity score and HEART score-due to missing components and late data entry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physician review of a verbal autopsy (VA) and completion of a death certificate remains the most widely used approach for VA analysis. This study provides new evidence about the performance of physician-certified verbal autopsy (PCVA) using defined clinical diagnostic criteria as a gold standard for a multisite sample of 12,542 VAs. The study was also designed to analyze issues related to PCVA, such as the impact of a second physician reader on the cause of death assigned, the variation in performance with and without household recall of health care experience (HCE), and the importance of local information for physicians reading VAs. METHODS: The certification was performed by 24 physicians. The assignment of VA was random and blinded. Each VA was certified by one physician. Half of the VAs were reviewed by a different physician with household recall of health care experience included. The completed death certificate was processed for automated ICD-10 coding of the underlying cause of death. PCVA was compared to gold standard cause of death assignment based on strictly defined clinical diagnostic criteria that are part of the Population Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) gold standard verbal autopsy study. RESULTS: For individual cause assignment, the overall chance-corrected concordance for PCVA against the gold standard cause of death is less than 50%, with substantial variability by cause and physician. Physicians assign the correct cause around 30% of the time without HCE, and addition of HCE improves performance in adults to 45% and slightly higher in children to 48%. Physicians estimate cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs) with considerable error for adults, children, and neonates. Only for neonates for a cause list of six causes with HCE is accuracy above 0.7. In all three age groups, CSMF accuracy improves when household recall of health care experience is available. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that physician coding for cause of death assignment may not be as robust as previously thought. The time and cost required to initially collect the verbal autopsies must be considered in addition to the analysis, as well as the impact of diverting physicians from servicing immediate health needs in a population to review VAs. All of these considerations highlight the importance and urgency of developing better methods to more reliably analyze past and future verbal autopsies to obtain the highest quality mortality data from populations without reliable death certification.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The clinical course of multiple sclerosis (MS) is highly variable, and research data collection is costly and time consuming. We evaluated natural language processing techniques applied to electronic medical records (EMR) to identify MS patients and the key clinical traits of their disease course. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used four algorithms based on ICD-9 codes, text keywords, and medications to identify individuals with MS from a de-identified, research version of the EMR at Vanderbilt University. Using a training dataset of the records of 899 individuals, algorithms were constructed to identify and extract detailed information regarding the clinical course of MS from the text of the medical records, including clinical subtype, presence of oligoclonal bands, year of diagnosis, year and origin of first symptom, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, timed 25-foot walk scores, and MS medications. Algorithms were evaluated on a test set validated by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: We identified 5789 individuals with MS. For all clinical traits extracted, precision was at least 87% and specificity was greater than 80%. Recall values for clinical subtype, EDSS scores, and timed 25-foot walk scores were greater than 80%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This collection of clinical data represents one of the largest databases of detailed, clinical traits available for research on MS. This work demonstrates that detailed clinical information is recorded in the EMR and can be extracted for research purposes with high reliability.

AB  - AIM: We aim to create and validate an electronic search algorithm for accurate detection of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) from medical records. METHODS: Patients with DIC in Mayo Clinic's intensive care units (ICUs) from Jan 1, 2007, to May 4, 2018, were included in the study. An algorithm was developed based on clinical notes and ICD diagnosis codes. A cohort of 50 patients was included with DIC diagnosis, its variations, and no diagnosis of DIC. Then, the next set of 50 patients was used to refine the algorithm. Results were compared with a manual reviewer and the disagreements were resolved by the third reviewer. The same process was repeated with 'revised clinical note search' for the first and second derivation cohort with additional exclusion terms. The obtained sensitivity and specificity were reported. The generated algorithm was applied to another set of 50 patients for validation. RESULTS: In the first derivation cohort- DIC search by clinical notes and diagnosis codes had 92% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Sensitivity dropped to 71% in the second cohort although specificity remains the same. Therefore, the algorithm was refined to clinical notes search only. The revised search was reapplied to first and second derivation cohorts and results obtained for the first derivation were the same but 91.3% sensitive and 100% specific for the second derivation. The search was locked and applied in the validation cohort with 95.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity, respectively. CONCLUSION: The revised clinical note based electronic search algorithm was found to be highly sensitive and specific for DIC during the corresponding ICU duration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Data on the utilization of open, laparoscopic and robotic adrenalectomy on a national level is limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on patients who underwent open, laparoscopic, or robotic adrenalectomy for benign or malignant disease in the US from 2003-2013 were extracted using ICD-9 codes from the Premier Hospital Database. Surgeon specialty, patient demographics, hospital characteristics, and complications were compared. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 8,831 adrenalectomies were performed for benign and malignant tumors. There was no significant difference in rate of adrenalectomy with regards to comorbidities, insurance status, or hospital characteristics. Non-urologists performed adrenalectomy more often for both benign (57% versus 43%; p = 0.011) and malignant disease (66% versus 34%; p = 0.011). Across all indications, non-urologists performed open surgery most often followed by laparoscopic and robotic approaches (56.3% versus 37.4% versus 6.4%, respectively), compared to urologists (48.8% versus 38.4% versus 12.9%, respectively). Overall, urologists were more likely to use laparoscopic or robotic approaches (p = 0.001). There was no difference in complication rates or operative times between surgical specialties or by surgeon/hospital case volume. On multivariable regression analysis, the best predictor of major complication was a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) ≥ 2 (OR 3.9, 95%CI 2.1-7.1; p = < 0.001). Compared to open surgery, laparoscopy had significantly reduced odds of major complication (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-0.9; p = 0.03). Patients undergoing robotic procedures had the shortest length of stay. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, adrenalectomy was more commonly performed by non-urologists via an open approach. Patients with CCI ≥ 2 were more likely to have postoperative complications while surgeon volume, hospital volume, and surgical approach did not influence complication rates.

AB  - PURPOSE: Efficient and adequate coding is essential for all hospitals to optimize funding, follow activity, and perform epidemiological studies. OBJECTIVE: We propose an autocompletion method for optimizing diagnostic coding in acute care hospitals. METHODS: Using a terminology snowflake model integrating SNOMED 3.5 and ICD-10 codes, autocompletion algorithms generate a list of diagnostic expressions from partial input concepts. RESULTS: A general autocompletion component has been developed and tested on a set of inpatient summary reports. Concepts expressed as strings of three or four characters return a noisy list of diagnostic labels or codes. Concepts expressed as groups of strings return lists that are semantically close to the labels present in hospital reports. The most pertinent information lies in the length of the expressions entered. CONCLUSION: Autocompletion can be a complementary tool to existing coding support systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chloride is an extracellular anion commonly measured using ion-selective electrode methods standardized to traceable reference materials. This study investigates the gradual appearance of a positive bias in chloride measurements using the Siemens Healthineers Atellica CH platform that was undetectable via routine quality control or proficiency testing. METHODS: The bias was characterized using retrospective analysis of laboratory values from presumable healthy outpatients (ICD-10 code Z00.00), reference interval verifications, peer group means from the College of American Pathologists' proficiency testing C survey, and a method comparison study with an alternate platform. RESULTS: Retrospective analysis of patient data (2017-2024) revealed a gradual shift in median patient chloride concentrations distinct from stable trends observed for other electrolytes. In 2024, reference interval verification revealed that 64.3% of chloride results were above the reference interval, even though the verification was successful in 2021. Proficiency testing results were acceptable compared to peer method; however, revealed a mean positive bias of 3.19 mmol/L when compared to other indirect ISE methods (2019-2024). A method comparison with an alternate chemistry platform demonstrated a mean bias of +4.3 mmol/L using remnant patient samples. CONCLUSIONS: The use of peer targets for quality control and proficiency testing concealed the detection of a gradual drift in chloride measurements in our laboratory. Analysis of aggregate patient data using ICD-10 codes represents a powerful tool for laboratories when assay performance is questioned. These findings highlight the need for vigilant monitoring of assay drift even for routine analytes to avert potential impact on patient care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few population-based data describing outcomes of robotic-assisted surgery. We compared outcomes of robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open surgery in a nationally representative population database. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from October 2008 to December 2009 was performed. We identified the most common robotic procedures by ICD-9 procedure codes and grouped them into categories by procedure type. Multivariate analyses examined mortality, length of stay (LOS), and total hospital charges, adjusting for age, race, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, and teaching hospital status. RESULTS: A total of 368,239 patients were identified. On adjusted analysis, compared with open, robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery was associated with decreased odds of mortality (odds ratio = 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-0.2; p < 0.001), decreased mean LOS (-2.4 days; 95% CI, -2.5 to 2.3; p < 0.001), and increased mean total charges in all procedures (range $3,852 to $15,329) except coronary artery bypass grafting (-$17,318; 95% CI, -34,492 to -143; p = 0.048) and valvuloplasty (not statistically significant). Compared with laparoscopic, robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery was associated with decreased odds of mortality (odds ratio = 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-0.6; p = 0.008), decreased LOS overall (-0.6 days; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.5; p < 0.001), but increased LOS in prostatectomy and other kidney/bladder procedures (0.3 days; 95% CI, 0.1-0.4; p = 0.006; 0.8 days; 95% CI, 0.0-1.6; p = 0.049), and increased total charges ($1,309; 95% CI, 519-2,099; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that, compared with open surgery, robotic-assisted surgery results in decreased LOS and diminished likelihood of death. However, these benefits are not as apparent when comparing robotic-assisted laparoscopic with nonrobotic laparoscopic procedures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of calculating the chlamydia Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measure using administrative data available in a mixed-model managed care organization (MCO). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: A review of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), Current Procedural Termin-ology (CPT), Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), and National Drug Code codes and electronic laboratory files in 1998 and a medical chart review to validate sexual activity and chlamydia testing codes specified by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) in 1999 for the chlamydia HEDIS 2000 measure. RESULTS: Fewer than 25% of female enrollees with laboratory evidence of a chlamydia test had a CPT code for chlamydia testing as specified by the NCQA. Non-pathogen-specific test codes instead of NCQA-specified codes were used in 1998 to code chlamydia tests. By incorporating electronic laboratory data into the automated claims-generating process, all chlamydia tests performed at staff-model clinics were coded. Use of pharmacy dispensing data to identify contraceptive prescriptions increased the proportion of enrollees classified as sexually active by 4% to 5% vs documentation of sexual activity using ICD-9, CPT, and HCPCS codes only. CONCLUSIONS: The MCO quality assurance specialists examining chlamydia testing rates under HEDIS may want to evaluate chlamydia testing coding practices in their MCOs to determine whether simple changes in coding practices may present a more accurate picture of actual testing practices. The proportion of female enrollees classified as sexually active using different data available in the staff and network models varied only slightly.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of databases that are maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are of relevance to investigators involved in epidemiologic, clinical, and health services research. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We reviewed both national and local VA databases and identified their strengths and limitations. We also referenced specific studies that have assessed the validity and reliability of VA databases. RESULTS: There are numerous national databases housed at the Austin Automation Center in Austin, Texas. These include the Patient Treatment File (hospital abstracts), the Outpatient Care File, the Beneficiary Identification Record Locator System death file for assessing vital status, and the Decision Support System, which provides integrated clinical and financial information for managerial decision making. The major limitation of these databases is that clinical detail below the level of ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes is not uniformly available nationally. These databases offer an excellent opportunity to monitor the health of veterans over time because they track all inpatient and outpatient utilization in the VA. However, at the local or medical center level, the Veterans Health Information and Systems and Technology Architecture contains extensive clinical information, but has fewer patients, varies in format across medical centers, and poses difficulties with data extraction for statistical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Both local and national VA databases are valuable resources for investigators who have interests in a wide array of research topics, including diabetes. The potential for investigating important scientific questions with VA databases becomes greater as communications and database management technologies improve.

AB  - Wikipedia, a multilingual online encyclopedia, is a common starting point for patient medical searches. As its articles can be authored and edited by anyone worldwide, the credibility of the medical content of Wikipedia has been openly questioned. Wikipedia medical articles have also been criticized as too advanced for the general public. This study assesses the comprehensiveness, reliability, and readability of nephrology articles on Wikipedia. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related problems, 10th Edition (ICD-10) diagnostic codes for nephrology (N00-N29.8) were used as a topic list to investigate the English Wikipedia database. Comprehensiveness was assessed by the proportion of ICD-10 codes that had corresponding articles. Reliability was measured by both the number of references per article and proportion of references from substantiated sources. Finally, readability was assessed using three validated indices (Flesch-Kincaid grade level, Automated readability index, and Flesch reading ease). Nephrology articles on Wikipedia were relatively comprehensive, with 70.5% of ICD-10 codes being represented. The articles were fairly reliable, with 7.1 ± 9.8 (mean ± SD) references per article, of which 59.7 ± 35.0% were substantiated references. Finally, all three readability indices determined that nephrology articles are written at a college level. Wikipedia is a comprehensive and fairly reliable medical resource for nephrology patients that is written at a college reading level. Accessibility of this information for the general public may be improved by hosting it at alternative Wikipedias targeted at a lower reading level, such as the Simple English Wikipedia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deep learning approaches have tremendous potential to improve the predictive power of traditional suicide prediction models to detect and predict intentional self-harm (ISH). Existing research is limited by a general lack of consistent performance and replicability across sites. We aimed to validate a deep learning approach used in previous research to detect and predict ISH using clinical note text and evaluate its generalizability to other academic medical centers. METHODS: We extracted clinical notes from electronic health records (EHRs) of 1,538 patients with International Classification of Diseases codes for ISH and 3,012 matched controls without ISH codes. We evaluated the performance of two traditional bag-of-words models (i.e., Naïve Bayes, Random Forest) and two convolutional neural network (CNN) models including randomly initialized (CNNr) and pre-trained Word2Vec initialized (CNNw) weights to detect ISH within 24 hours of and predict ISH from clinical notes 1-6 months before the first ISH event. RESULTS: In detecting concurrent ISH, both CNN models outperformed bag-of-words models with AUCs of.99 and F1 scores of 0.94. In predicting future ISH, the CNN models outperformed Naïve Bayes models with AUCs of 0.81-0.82 and F1 scores of 0.61-.64. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that leveraging EHRs with a well-defined set of ISH ICD codes to train deep learning models to detect and predict ISH using clinical note text is feasible and replicable at more than one institution. Future work will examine this approach across multiple sites under less controlled settings using both structured and unstructured EHR data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of subsequent leiomyoma surgery following myomectomy in a population-based cohort. METHODS: All women, ages 20-75 years, enrolled in a large HMO in Washington State, identified by CPT and ICD-9 codes as having a myomectomy between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2002, were eligible for the study. The follow-up period was 0.1-11 years. Automated enrollment and inpatient, outpatient, pathology, and procedure data were linked. Age-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional hazard models, age-specific Kaplan Meier estimates of cumulative risk, and incidence of uterine surgery after myomectomy were calculated. RESULTS: Among 628 eligible women, 127 (21.8%) had a second surgery, 95 (74.8%) of which were hysterectomies. The cumulative incidence of a second surgery was 23.5% at 5 years and 30% at 7 years. During 2766.5 woman-years of follow-up, the annual incidence of a subsequent myoma surgery was 4.6%. Compared with women aged 40-44, women >or=50 had a 50% decreased risk for subsequent surgery (HR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of subsequent surgery for leiomyomas following myomectomy is high, almost 5% per year.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: ICD-10 diagnostic codes could be useful for automated surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). This study analyzed the validity of different SARI case definitions (CD) based on ICD-10 codes at hospital discharge in Catalonia, the Valencian Community, Galicia and the Basque Country between weeks 21/2021 and 39/2023. METHODS: Patients with respiratory system codes (J00 to J99, R06, U07) and with a laboratory test performed were included, with the gold standard being positivity to the corresponding pathogen. The validity of all possible combinations of ICD-10 codes was estimated, prioritizing the CDs according to the average sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp). Validity was estimated by age groups, but expert criteria were used to seek the optimal CD, unique for each pathogen, balancing validity and simplicity. RESULTS: The CD selected for influenza for any age included the specific codes J09.X, J10.0, J10.1, J10.2, J10.8 and J11 (Se=95.4; Sp=99.7), and for SARS-CoV-2, codes U07.1 and J12.8 (Se=95.9; Sp=98.3). For RSV, validity was lower, with significant heterogeneity by age and inclusion of non-specific codes. The optimal CD included codes J06, J12.1, J13, J20.5, J21.0 and J45 (Se=63.9; Sp=88.4), recommending adding J98 for adults and when it is important to maximize Se (Se=88.9; Sp=65.3). The overall CD for the three viruses was consistent with the specific CDs. CONCLUSIONS: The ICD-10 codes provides great validity in identifying influenza and SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations, but shows poorer performance and greater age-group variability for RSV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) patients is largely based on pattern recognition by providers, and this can be automated through electronic medical systems (EMR). METHODS: All patients in a large academic hospital with age > 60, ICD-10 code for chronic diastolic heart failure and no previous diagnosis of any amyloidosis were included. An Epic EMR scoring logic assigned risk scores to patients for ICD-10 and CPT codes associated with ATTR-CA, as follows: carpal tunnel syndrome (score 5), aortic stenosis/TAVR (5), neuropathy (4), bundle branch block (4), etc. The individual patients' scores were added, and patients were arranged in descending order of total scores- ranging from 50 to 0. Data is reported as median (interquartile range) and analyzed with non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Of the total 11,648 patients identified, 132 consecutive patients with highest risk scores (score ≥ 30) were enrolled as cases, while 132 patients with scores between 10 and 19 with available echocardiography data served as age-matched controls. Strain echocardiography is not routinely performed. Patients with high scores were more likely to have CA associated findings- African-American race, higher left ventricular (LV) mass index and left atrial volume and lower LV ejection fraction. High score patients had higher troponin and a trend towards high NT-proBNP. CONCLUSION: The modern EMR can be used to flag patients with high risk for ATTR-CA (score ≥ 30 using the proposed logic) through best practice advisory. This could encourage screening during echocardiography using strain or during unsuspected clinic visits.

AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated trends and associated characteristics in the use of robotics for pyeloplasty as treatment for ureteropelvic junction obstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample were used to evaluate pyeloplasty trends from 2005 to 2010. Patients treated with pyeloplasty and procedure method (robotic, laparoscopic or open) were identified by ICD-9-CM codes. Coding for robotics was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Multivariable analysis was performed to examine characteristics affecting the odds of undergoing robotic pyeloplasty vs other approaches to pyeloplasty. RESULTS: We identified 3,947 pyeloplasties performed between 2005 and 2010, including 1,642 since the fourth quarter of 2008. There was a statistically significant increase in the number of robotic pyeloplasties (p <0.001). Mean total charges for robotic vs nonrobotic procedures were $40,200 vs $37,817 (p = 0.106). Characteristics related to undergoing a robotic procedure included surgery at a teaching hospital (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04-1.59, p = 0.021) and in the Northeast (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.17-2.04, p = 0.002) or Midwest (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.23-2.12, p <0.001) compared with the South. When the primary payer was Medicaid vs private insurance, patients were 46% less likely to undergo the procedure robotically (p <0.001). There was no significant difference in charges between robotic and open pyeloplasty. CONCLUSIONS: The number of robotic pyeloplasties performed quarterly in the United States is increasing, although there are disparities in the adoption of the robotic approach among geographic regions and hospital types.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There are many published clinical guidelines for acute pancreatitis (AP). Implementation of these recommendations is variable. We hypothesized that a clinical decision support (CDS) tool would change clinician behavior and shorten hospital length of stay (LOS). DESIGN/SETTING: Observational study, entitled, The AP Early Response (TAPER) Project. Tertiary center emergency department (ED) and hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two consecutive samplings of patients having ICD-9 code (577.0) for AP were generated from the emergency department (ED) or hospital admissions. Diagnosis of AP was based on conventional Atlanta criteria. The Pre-TAPER-CDS-Tool group (5/30/06-6/22/07) had 110 patients presenting to the ED with AP per 976 ICD-9 (577.0) codes and the Post-TAPER-CDS-Tool group (5/30/06-6/22/07) had 113 per 907 ICD-9 codes (7/14/10-5/5/11). INTERVENTION: The TAPER-CDS-Tool, developed 12/2008-7/14/2010, is a combined early, automated paging-alert system, which text pages ED clinicians about a patient with AP and an intuitive web-based point-of-care instrument, consisting of seven early management recommendations. RESULTS: The pre- vs. post-TAPER-CDS-Tool groups had similar baseline characteristics. The post-TAPER-CDS-Tool group met two management goals more frequently than the pre-TAPER-CDS-Tool group: risk stratification (P<0.0001) and intravenous fluids >6L/1st 0-24 h (P=0.0003). Mean (s.d.) hospital LOS was significantly shorter in the post-TAPER-CDS-Tool group (4.6 (3.1) vs. 6.7 (7.0) days, P=0.0126). Multivariate analysis identified four independent variables for hospital LOS: the TAPER-CDS-Tool associated with shorter LOS (P=0.0049) and three variables associated with longer LOS: Japanese severity score (P=0.0361), persistent organ failure (P=0.0088), and local pancreatic complications (<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The TAPER-CDS-Tool is associated with changed clinician behavior and shortened hospital LOS, which has significant financial implications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To develop and validate algorithms to automate the calculation of Healthcare Quality and Safety Indicators (HQSIs) from electronic health records (EHR) multi-sources data. METHODS: Three HQSIs of interest were identified by experts. The required variables were identified and algorithms for extracting these variables from various sources of EHR data, prioritized based on their quality, were performed and evaluated on the Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) and Bordeaux University Hospital clinical data warehouses (CDWs). Algorithm performances (positive predictive value (PPV), accuracy, f1-score) were assessed to a manual review of 100 EHRs randomly selected among newly referred patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) in 2023. RESULTS: Three HQSI were computed: number of newly referred HNC, number of HNC cases treated by front line anticancer surgery and the number of resected HNC cases requiring a post-operative surgery based on ICD-10 and their French Association pour le Développement de l’Informatique en Cytologie et en Anatomie Pathologique (ADICAP) pathology codes, 6,943 and 7,112 HNC patients were identified as referred to AP-HP and Bordeaux University Hospitals between 1998 and 2023, respectively. The algorithm related to the number of newly referred HNC diagnoses in 2023 had the following performances: PPV of 37% and 87% when ICD-10 codes solely were used, up to 89% and 100% when both data sources (ICD-10 and ADICAP codes) were used, in AP-HP and Bordeaux University Hospitals, respectively. The average discrepancy rate between both data sources was 44%. Based on surgery French coding of medical procedures (CCAM) and pathology ADICAP codes, 4, 231 newly referred HNC patients were identified with a frontline cancer surgery in AP-HP, between 1998 and 2024. The accuracy of such algorithm ranged from 65% for patients identified by CCAM solely to 84% for patients identified by CCAM and ADICAP codes. Among them, 436 patients had a surgical re-intervention in the 28 following days. Floor of the mouth (OR = 1.72; CI95, 1.02–2.90), mouth (OR = 1.59; CI95, 1.07–2.38), pyriform sinus (OR = 4.83; CI95, 1.65–14.13), and facial sinus cases (OR = 0.11; CI95, 0.02–0.82) were primary tumor sites with a modified risk of surgical re-intervention, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging data from heterogeneous sources of EHR remains promising to improve the HQSI automated measurement for HNC patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: Accurate classification of prostate cancer (PC) disease states defined by the presence or absence of metastasis and castration resistance (CRPC) is critical but challenging in population-based research. As chart review is not feasible on a large scale, accurate automated methods are needed. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using data from the Veterans Affairs Health Care System to evaluate algorithms for identifying CRPC and metastatic PC, with manual chart review as the gold standard. Our analysis included 8336 patients for CRPC classification and 721 for metastatic disease classification. For CRPC classification, we assessed one novel algorithm using criteria including rising prostate-specific antigen levels or progression to metastatic disease while receiving androgen deprivation therapy or initiating CRPC-specific treatments. For metastatic disease detection, we assessed four algorithms based on: ICD codes alone, natural language processing (NLP) alone, a novel algorithm combining ICD codes and treatment patterns, and an enhanced version of the novel algorithm integrating NLP, evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of each. Positive and negative predictive values were reported across a range of assumed disease prevalence. RESULTS: Out of 8336 patients with PC, 1190 (14.3%) were identified as having CRPC through chart review, with the CRPC algorithm achieving 85.1% sensitivity and 96.1% specificity. Among 721 patients evaluated for metastatic disease, 179 (24.8%) were identified as having metastatic disease through chart review. The algorithm combining ICD codes, treatment patterns, and NLP demonstrated the highest sensitivity (94.4%) and high specificity (93.0%), while other methods had lower sensitivity with varied specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that our CRPC algorithm and the combined ICD codes, treatment patterns, and NLP algorithm for metastasis are effective automated approaches for identifying advanced states of PC. In particular, integrating NLP boosted sensitivity for metastatic classification with minimal specificity trade-off, highlighting the value of a multifaceted approach to large-scale PC research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of ICD-9-CM external-cause-of-injury codes (e-codes) assigned to the medical records of injured patients treated in an ED and released. METHODS: A comparison was made of routine coding and expert recoding of medical records generated in the ED for a convenience sample of patients treated for injuries within 24 hours of injury occurrence and subsequently released from the ED. The medical record was handwritten and subsequently coded by three medical records coders (MRCs). The e-coded charts were sent to an external medical record consultant (expert), who was blinded to the codes previously assigned. The expert reading was used as the criterion standard. Accuracy was measured using a kappa statistic, and errors were described. RESULTS: Of 126 available patient charts, 108 (85.7%) were assigned e-codes by MRCs. The expert assigned two codes to (double-coded) 67 patients, while the MRCs double-coded only one patient. The additional code was usually a "place of occurrence code." In 60 cases (55.6%), the expert code exactly matched the MRC code; kappa = 0.462. Of the 48 mismatches (44.4%), 20 (41.7%) were e-coded in the wrong category, 20 (41.7%) were e-coded in the correct category but with incorrect specificity of information, either too specific or not specific enough, and eight (16.6%) had combined coding errors. CONCLUSION: The accuracy of e-codes assigned to ED records was moderate in this single institution analysis. Errors were predominantly related to the specificity of the code, but some e-codes were in the wrong category. There are implications for injury surveillance and research. E-code assignment must be standardized and applied uniformly to obtain accurate codes. Automation of e-coding could improve accuracy and consistency of codes. National and international epidemiologic studies of cause of injury among ED patients will be severely hampered until e-code assignment can be better standardized.

AB  - Large administrative databases are increasingly valuable tools for health care research. Although increased access to these databases provides valuable opportunities to study health care utilization, costs and outcomes and valid and comparable results require explicit and consistent analytic methods. Algorithms for identifying surgical and nonsurgical hospitalizations for "mechanical" low back problems in automated databases are described. Sixty-six ICD-9-CM diagnosis and 15 procedure codes that could be applied to patients with mechanical low back problems were identified. Twenty-seven diagnosis and two procedure codes identify hospitalizations for problems definitely in the lumbar or lumbosacral region. Exclusion criteria were developed to eliminate nonmechanical causes of low back pain, such as malignancies, infections, and major trauma. The use of the algorithms is illustrated using national hospital discharge data.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Regulatory authorities often receive poorly structured safety reports requiring considerable effort to investigate potential adverse events post hoc. Automated question-and-answer systems may help to improve the overall quality of safety information transmitted to pharmacovigilance agencies. This paper explores the use of the VACC-Tool (ViVI Automated Case Classification Tool) 2.0, a mobile application enabling physicians to classify clinical cases according to 14 pre-defined case definitions for neuroinflammatory adverse events (NIAE) and in full compliance with data standards issued by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium. METHODS: The validation of the VACC-Tool 2.0 (beta-version) was conducted in the context of a unique quality management program for children with suspected NIAE in collaboration with the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, Germany. The VACC-Tool was used for instant case classification and for longitudinal follow-up throughout the course of hospitalization. Results were compared to International Classification of Diseases , Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes assigned in the emergency department (ED). RESULTS: From 07/2013 to 10/2014, a total of 34,368 patients were seen in the ED, and 5243 patients were hospitalized; 243 of these were admitted for suspected NIAE (mean age: 8.5 years), thus participating in the quality management program. Using the VACC-Tool in the ED, 209 cases were classified successfully, 69 % of which had been missed or miscoded in the ED reports. Longitudinal follow-up with the VACC-Tool identified additional NIAE. CONCLUSION: Mobile applications are taking data standards to the point of care, enabling clinicians to ascertain potential adverse events in the ED setting and during inpatient follow-up. Compliance with Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) data standards facilitates data interoperability according to regulatory requirements.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after major surgery and is associated with poor outcomes in older adults. Early identification of patients at high risk of POD can enable targeted prevention efforts. However, existing POD prediction models require inpatient data collected during the hospital stay, which delays predictions and limits scalability. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and externally validate a machine learning-based prediction model for POD using routine electronic health record (EHR) data. METHODS: We identified all surgical encounters from 2014 to 2021 for patients aged 50 years and older who underwent an operation requiring general anesthesia, with a length of stay of at least 1 day at 3 Indiana hospitals. Patients with preexisting dementia or mild cognitive impairment were excluded. POD was identified using Confusion Assessment Method records and delirium International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Controls without delirium or nurse-documented confusion were matched to cases by age, sex, race, and year of admission. We trained logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and neural network models to predict POD using 143 features derived from routine EHR data available at the time of hospital admission. Separate models were developed for each hospital using surveillance periods of 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year before admission. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Each model was internally validated using holdout data and externally validated using data from the other 2 hospitals. Calibration was assessed using calibration curves. RESULTS: The study cohort included 7167 delirium cases and 7167 matched controls. XGB outperformed all other classifiers. AUROCs were highest for XGB models trained on 12 months of preadmission data. The best-performing XGB model achieved a mean AUROC of 0.79 (SD 0.01) on the holdout set, which decreased to 0.69-0.74 (SD 0.02) when externally validated on data from other hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Our routine EHR-based POD prediction models demonstrated good predictive ability using a limited set of preadmission and surgical variables, though their generalizability was limited. The proposed models could be used as a scalable, automated screening tool to identify patients at high risk of POD at the time of hospital admission.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Identifying major bleeding is fundamental to assessing the outcomes of anticoagulation therapy. This drives the need for a credible implementation in automated data for the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definition of major bleeding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 102,395 patients who received 158,511 person-years of warfarin treatment from the Veterans Health Administration (VA) between 10/1/06-9/30/08. We constructed a list of ICD-9-CM codes of "candidate" bleeding events. Each candidate event was identified as a major hemorrhage if it fulfilled one of four criteria: 1) associated with death within 30days; 2) bleeding in a critical anatomic site; 3) associated with a transfusion; or 4) was coded as the event that precipitated or was responsible for the majority of an inpatient hospitalization. RESULTS: This definition classified 11,240 (15.8%) of 71, 338 candidate events as major hemorrhage. Typically, events more likely to be severe were retained at higher rates than those less likely to be severe. For example, Diverticula of Colon with Hemorrhage (562.12) and Hematuria (599.7) were retained 46% and 4% of the time, respectively. Major, intracranial, and fatal hemorrhage were identified at rates comparable to those found in randomized clinical trials however, higher than those reported in observational studies: 4.73, 1.29, and 0.41 per 100 patient years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We describe here a workable definition for identifying major hemorrhagic events from large automated datasets. This method of identifying major bleeding may have applications for quality measurement, quality improvement, and comparative effectiveness research.

AB  - PURPOSE: Tumor registry (TR) data are becoming more prominently cited in research through increased use of the National Cancer Database. We aimed to establish the accuracy of TR data by comparing them with physician medical record review (MD review) using pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) as an example. METHODS: For MD review, the health information system of an academic medical center was queried for patients with pancreatic International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), codes from January 2000 to August 2008. A single physician investigator analyzed those medical records and identified patients with pancreatic NETs. For TR data, patients with pancreatic NETs were identified by two separate strategies. For the period of January 2000 to December 2006, patients were identified through manual review of pathology reports, admission and discharge sheets, and clinic visit logs. For January 2007 to August 2008, patients were identified using an automated case-finding program. RESULTS: In MD review, 1,192 patients with pancreatic ICD-9 codes were identified, 34 of whom were found to have pancreatic NETs. The TR indicated 15 patients with pancreatic NETs, four of whom were not identified during MD review. Of the total 38 patients identified by either strategy, pancreatic NET identification rate of the TR was 39.5% compared with 89.5% in MD review. CONCLUSION: Academic TR analysis indicates a substantial proportion of patients with pancreatic NETs are not identified when compared with MD review. Most instances of patients going unidentified are the result of registry time lag and case-finding methodologies; specifically, physicians may define tumors with malignant potential differently. This may be applicable to other individual tumor registries as well as aggregate registry-based national studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiology of upper limb vascular trauma across Brazil and evaluate the incidence rates, demographic characteristics, lethality, days of hospitalization, and related healthcare costs. METHODS: This retrospective analysis used data from the Brazilian public health system over sixteen years (2008-2023). Automated data extraction utilized Python-based tools to gather information on vascular trauma procedures identified by ICD-10 codes. Statistical analyses were performed to assess variations in incidence, lethality, and treatment costs across Brazilian regions. RESULTS: A total of 25,573 cases of upper limb vascular trauma were recorded. Most cases occurred in males (79.8%) with a mean age of 34.7 years. The region in Brazil with the highest incidence of upper limb vascular trauma was the North (16.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), while the Southeast had the lowest (10.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The average length of hospital stay was 4.39 days, and 92.8% of the patients did not require admission to the intensive care unit. Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit, the average length of stay was 4.52 days. The overall lethality of upper limb vascular trauma was 2.37%, with higher lethality observed in bilateral upper limb vascular trauma (3.81%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of upper limb vascular trauma is higher in Brazil than in developed countries, even after adjusting for population size. However, lethality and hospitalization duration did not appear to differ significantly from those in developed countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: GlycA is a biomarker that reflects integrated concentrations and glycosylation states of several acute-phase proteins. We studied the association of GlycA and inflammatory biomarkers with future death and disease. METHODS: A total of 6523 men and women in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis who were free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD) and in generally good health had a baseline blood sample taken. We assayed high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and d-dimer. A spectral deconvolution algorithm was used to quantify GlycA signal amplitudes from automated nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) LipoProfile® test spectra. Median follow-up was 12.1 years. Among 4 primary outcomes, CVD events were adjudicated, death was by death certificate, and chronic inflammatory-related severe hospitalization and death (ChrIRD) and total cancer were classified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. We used Poisson regression to study baseline GlycA, hsCRP, IL-6, and d-dimer in relation to total death, CVD, ChrIRD, and total cancer. RESULTS: Relative risk per SD of GlycA, IL-6, and d-dimer for total death (n = 915); for total CVD (n = 922); and for ChrIRD (n = 1324) ranged from 1.05 to 1.20, independently of covariates. In contrast, prediction from hsCRP was statistically explained by adjustment for other inflammatory variables. Only GlycA was predictive for total cancer (n = 663). Women had 7% higher values of all inflammatory biomarkers than men and had a significantly lower GlycA prediction coefficient than men in predicting total cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The composite biomarker GlycA derived from NMR is associated with risk for total death, CVD, ChrIRD, and total cancer after adjustment for hsCRP, IL-6, and d-dimer. IL-6 and d-dimer contribute information independently of GlycA.

AB  - AIMS: To compare (1) complication and (2) conversion rates to open surgery (OS) from laparoscopic surgery (LS) and robotic-assisted surgery (RA) for rectal cancer patients who underwent rectal resection. (3) To identify patient, physician, and hospital predictors of conversion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A US-based database study was conducted utilizing the 2012-2014 Premier Healthcare Data, including rectal cancer patients ≥18 with rectal resection. ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedural codes were utilized to identify surgical approaches, conversions to OS, and surgical complications. Propensity score matching on patient, surgeon, and hospital level characteristics was used to create comparable groups of RA\LS patients (n = 533 per group). Predictors of conversion from LS and RA to OS were identified with stepwise logistic regression in the unmatched sample. RESULTS: Post-match results suggested comparable perioperative complication rates (RA 29% vs LS 29%; p = .7784); whereas conversion rates to OS were 12% for RA vs 29% for LS (p < .0001). Colorectal surgeons (RA 9% vs LS 23%), general surgeons (RA 13% vs LS 35%), and smaller bed-size hospitals (RA 14% vs LS 33%) have reduced conversion rates for RA vs LS (p < .0001). Statistically significant predictors of conversion included LS, non-colorectal surgeon, and smaller bed-size hospitals. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective observational study limitations apply. Analysis of the hospital administrative database was subject to the data captured in the database and the accuracy of coding. Propensity score matching limitations apply. RA and LS groups were balanced with respect to measured patient, surgeon, and hospital characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to LS, RA offers a higher probability of completing a successful minimally invasive surgery for rectal cancer patients undergoing rectal resection without exacerbating complications. Male, obese, or moderately-to-severely ill patients had higher conversion rates. While colorectal surgeons had lower conversion rates from RA than LS, the reduction was magnified for general surgeons and smaller bed-size hospitals.

AB  - The isolation of affected patients and intensified infection control measures are used to prevent nosocomial transmission of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), but early detection of VRE carriers is needed. However, there are still no standard screening criteria for VRE, which poses a significant threat to patient safety. Our study aimed to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach for identifying and predicting of at-risk patients who could assist infection prevention and control staff through a human-in-the-loop approach. We used data from 8,372 patients, combining more than 125,000 movements within our hospital with patient-related information to create time-dependent graph sequences and applied graph neural networks (GNNs) to classify patients as VRE carriers or noncarriers. Our model achieves a macro F1 score of 0.880 on the task (sensitivity of 0.808, specificity of 0.942). The parameters with the strongest impact on the prediction are the codes for clinical diagnosis (ICD) and operations/procedures (OPS), which are integrated as high-dimensional patient node features in our model. We demonstrate that modeling a "living" hospital with a GNN is a promising approach for the early detection of potential VRE carriers. This proves that AI-based tools combining heterogeneous information types can predict VRE carriage with high sensitivity and could therefore serve as a promising basis for future automated infection prevention control systems. Such systems could help enhance patient safety and proactively reduce nosocomial transmission events through targeted, cost-efficient interventions. Moreover, they could enable a more effective approach to managing antimicrobial resistance.

This study leveraged artificial intelligence (AI)-based text-classification methods to improve the identification of patients with dementia due to ADRD using clinical notes from electronic health records (EHRs). METHODS: EHR data for patients aged ≥ 64 ( RESULTS: A foundational LLM derived from Llama 2 demonstrated superior performance in identifying patients with ADRD (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.9534,  DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the potential of AI-based text-classification methods to optimize the automated identification of patients with ADRD using rich EHR data. However, the success of this approach depends on the quality of clinical notes, and more work is needed to refine and validate these methods across more diverse data sets. HIGHLIGHTS: The current e-phenotype for patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in electronic health records has suboptimal diagnostic accuracy.The study used artificial intelligence (AI)-based text classification methods to improve the detection of patients with ADRD.AI-based models, including convolutional neural networks, outperformed the Chronic Conditions Warehouse algorithm.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diagnoses and medical procedures collected under the French system of information are recorded in a nationwide database, the "PMSI national database", which is accessible for exploitation. Quality of the data in this database is directly related to the quality of coding, which can be of poor quality. Among the proposed methods for the exploitation of health databases, data mining techniques are particularly interesting. Our objective is to build sequential rules for missing diagnoses prediction by data mining of the PMSI national database. METHOD: Our working sample was constructed from the national database for years 2007 to 2010. The information retained for rules construction were medical diagnoses and medical procedures. The rules were selected using a statistical filter, and selected rules were validated by case review based on medical letters, which enabled to estimate the improvement of diagnoses recoding. RESULTS: The work sample was made of 59,170 inpatient stays. The predicted ICD codes were E11 (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), I48 (atrial fibrillation and flutter) and I50 (heart failure).We validated three sequential rules with a substantial improvement of positive predictive value: {E11,I10,DZQM006}=>{E11} {E11,I10,I48}=>{E11} {I48,I69}=>{I48} DISCUSSION: We were able to extract by data mining three simple, reliable and effective sequential rules, with a substantial improvement in diagnoses recoding. The results of our study indicate the opportunity to improve the data quality of the national database by data mining methods.

AB  - PRCIS: Socioeconomic status is a potentially significant, although difficult to isolate, factor in determining glaucoma severity. PURPOSE: To analyze the level of glaucoma severity (mild, moderate, or severe) based on demographic factors, including age, gender, ethnicity, insurance profile, and zip code, and to use this data to extrapolate the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) and race on glaucoma severity at the community level in Memphis, TN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Totally, 2913 patients from a tertiary care center with 3 clinic locations in Memphis, TN who had been given the diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) through use of the ICD-10 codes for mild (H40.1111, H40.1121, H40.1131), moderate (H40.1112, H40.1122, H40.1132), and severe (H40.1113, H40.1123, H40.1133) POAG between January 2016 and July 2021 were included in this study. Diagnoses were made after a complete glaucoma workup consisting of Snellen visual acuity, applanation IOP measurement, gonioscopy, automated Humphreys visual fields (10-2 and 24-2), and optic nerve OCT. Demographic information, including age, gender, ethnicity, insurance profile, and zip code, was also collected with disease severity for each patient. SES was approximated using zip code-level census poverty data and insurance profiles. Statistical analyses were performed, including descriptive, multivariable ordinal logistic modeling, and stepwise multivariable linear modeling. RESULTS: Glaucoma severity was shown to increase with poverty rate (OR=1.089, P <0.0071), age (OR=1.030, P <0.0001), male sex (OR=1.374, P <0.0001), and Black race (OR=1.896, P <0.0001). Severity was shown to be decreased in patients with private insurance compared with Medicare (OR=0.895, P <0.093) and those from Shelby County compared with other counties (OR=0.703, P <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that worsening glaucoma severity was associated with higher poverty rates in our patient population. However, isolating socioeconomic status (SES) as an independent factor influencing the incidence and severity of glaucoma remains challenging, given the strong correlation between race and SES.

AB  - Association rule mining offers an automated approach for discovering new knowledge about diseases. A known challenge is how to constrain the search space to prevent an exponential explosion of rules while minimizing information loss. In this study, generalized association rule mining techniques were used to identify disease cooccurrences based on ICD-9-CM codes in a statewide hospital discharge data set. The Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) categorization scheme and the numerical hierarchy of ICD-9-CM were used to generalize the codes and produce generalized associations for comparison with associations generated from the raw data. By maintaining links between the raw and generalized data, associations lost in the generalization process, overlapping associations, and new associations were identified. In addition, preliminary results indicate that the concept hierarchy used for generalization may influence the associations found.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Use of free text in syndromic surveillance requires managing the substantial word variation that results from use of synonyms, abbreviations, acronyms, truncations, concatenations, misspellings, and typographic errors. Failure to detect these variations results in missed cases, and traditional methods for capturing these variations require ongoing, labor-intensive maintenance. OBJECTIVES: This paper examines the problem of word variation in chief-complaint data and explores three semi-automated approaches for addressing it. METHODS: Approximately 6 million chief complaints from patients reporting to emergency departments at 54 hospitals were analyzed. A method of text normalization that models the similarities between words was developed to manage the linguistic variability in chief complaints. Three approaches based on this method were investigated: 1) automated correction of spelling and typographical errors; 2) use of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to select chief complaints to mine for overlooked vocabulary; and 3) identification of overlooked vocabulary by matching words that appeared in similar contexts. RESULTS: The prevalence of word errors was high. For example, such words as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were misspelled 11.0%-18.8% of the time. Approximately 20% of all words were abbreviations or acronyms whose use varied substantially by site. Two methods, use of ICD-9-CM codes to focus searches and the automated pairing of words by context, both retrieved relevant but previously unexpected words. Text normalization simultaneously reduced the number of false positives and false negatives in syndrome classification, compared with commonly used methods based on word stems. In approximately 25% of instances, using text normalization to detect lower respiratory syndrome would have improved the sensitivity of current word-stem approaches by approximately 10%-20%. CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete vocabulary and word errors can have a substantial impact on the retrieval performance of free-text syndromic surveillance systems. The text normalization methods described in this paper can reduce the effects of these problems.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The outcomes of total hip arthroplasty (THA) are highly dependent upon the restoration of native hip biomechanics and optimal component positioning. Robotic technologies for THA have rapidly improved the accuracy of component positioning and maintaining the planned center of rotation. While robotic-assisted THA (RA-THA) has primarily been employed in surgically intricate cases, its potential benefits in scenarios of diminished surgical complexity remain less explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the odds of developing systemic and joint complications following RA-THA in cases of reduced surgical complexity. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TriNetX national database to identify patients who underwent primary THA (Current Procedural Terminology code 27,130) and more specifically RA-THA identified by ICD-10-PCS code 8E0Y0CZ and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code S2900 from 2013 to 2022. One-to-one propensity score matching was conducted to generate 2 cohorts: (1) RA-THA and (2) conventional THA (C-THA). Systemic and joint complications were assessed at the 30-day, 90-day, 1-year, and 5-year postoperative periods. RESULTS: Patients undergoing RA-THA had a lower risk of needing a revision THA at the 90-day, 1-year, and 5-year time points. RA-THA was associated with a lower risk of prosthetic dislocation at 90 days and 1 year and prosthetic pain at 1 year and 5 years. Dislocation of the hip or fracture of the femur was significantly lower in the RA-THA cohort at all four-time points. Patients undergoing RA-THA had a lower risk of developing deep vein thrombosis at 5 years. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that RA-THA has comparable systemic and less joint complication risks at 30-day to 5-year timepoints between RA-THA and C-THA. Future studies with large sample sizes and long-term follow-up are needed to understand the patient-reported outcomes and functional outcomes of RA-THA for cases with reduced surgical complexity.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need and value of a standardised and timely surveillance system for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) to inform epidemic preparedness and response.AIMWe aimed to develop an automated SARI surveillance system using electronic health records retrieved from pre-existing national health registers in Denmark.METHODSWe used the Danish Civil Register, the Danish National Patient Register and the Danish Microbiology Database to set up the system. First, we determined a SARI case definition for surveillance, choosing among six different potentially usable combinations of ICD-10 diagnosis codes by exploring how each combination captured patient characteristics (age, hospital admission length, mortality, laboratory tests and seasonality). Second, using this case definition, we evaluated the surveillance system's timeliness and completeness by comparing weekly data reported with a delay of 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 days, respectively, against a complete set of data extracted after 120 days.RESULTSThe selected case definition combined ICD-10 codes for influenza (J09-J11), acute lower viral and bacterial respiratory tract infections and bronchiolitis (J12-J22) and COVID-19 (B342A and B972A). With regards to timeliness and completeness of this definition, weekly data reported with a delay of 8 days was 89-93% complete and showed very similar patterns in weekly changes in SARI cases as data reported after 120 days.CONCLUSIONOur SARI surveillance system detected fluctuations in weekly SARI cases in a consistent and timely manner. We recommend countries to explore using electronic health registers as a resource-efficient alternative to standard SARI sentinel surveillance.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of using an automated approach to administrative claims data to assess the rate and risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI) in spinal procedures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: SSI is a major indicator of health care quality. A wide range of SSI rates have been proposed in the literature depending on clinical setting and procedure type. METHODS: All spinal surgeries performed at a university-affiliated tertiary-care center from July 2005 to December 2010 were identified using diagnosis-related group, current procedural terminology, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes and were validated through chart review. Rates of SSI and associated risk factors were calculated using univariate regression analysis. Odds ratios were calculated through multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 6628 hospital visits were identified. The cumulative incidence of SSI was 2.9%. Procedural risk factors associated with a statistically significant increase in rates of infection were the following: sacral involvement (9.6%), fusions greater than 7 levels (7.8%), fusions greater than 12 levels (10.4%), cases with an osteotomy (6.5%), operative time longer than 5 hours (5.1%), transfusions of red blood cells (5.0%), serum (7.4%), and autologous blood (4.1%). Patient-based risk factors included anemia (4.3%), diabetes mellitus (4.2%), coronary artery disease (4.7%), diagnosis of coagulopathy (7.8%), and bone or connective tissue neoplasm (5.0%). CONCLUSION: Used individually, diagnosis-related group, current procedural terminology, and ICD-9 codes cannot completely capture a patient population. Using an algorithm combining all 3 coding systems to generate both inclusion and exclusion criteria, we were able to analyze a specific population of spinal surgery patients within a high-volume medical center. Within that group, risk factors found to increase infection rates were isolated and can serve to focus hospital-wide efforts to decrease surgery-related morbidity and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although physical illnesses, routinely documented in electronic medical records (EMR), have been found to be a contributing factor to suicides, no automated systems use this information to predict suicide risk. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to quantify the impact of physical illnesses on suicide risk, and develop a predictive model that captures this relationship using EMR data. METHODS: We used history of physical illnesses (except chapter V: Mental and behavioral disorders) from EMR data over different time-periods to build a lookup table that contains the probability of suicide risk for each chapter of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. The lookup table was then used to predict the probability of suicide risk for any new assessment. Based on the different lengths of history of physical illnesses, we developed six different models to predict suicide risk. We tested the performance of developed models to predict 90-day risk using historical data over differing time-periods ranging from 3 to 48 months. A total of 16,858 assessments from 7399 mental health patients with at least one risk assessment was used for the validation of the developed model. The performance was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The best predictive results were derived (AUC=0.71) using combined data across all time-periods, which significantly outperformed the clinical baseline derived from routine risk assessment (AUC=0.56). The proposed approach thus shows potential to be incorporated in the broader risk assessment processes used by clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a novel approach to exploit the history of physical illnesses extracted from EMR (ICD-10 codes without chapter V-mental and behavioral disorders) to predict suicide risk, and this model outperforms existing clinical assessments of suicide risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cause-of-death statistics are widely used for comparing health characteristics of European Community (EC) countries. Before attempting to interpret between-country differences, it is essential to assess the biases affecting the comparability of the data. EUROSTAT decided to address globally this problem with the objective to improve the quality and comparability of cause-of-death data within the EC. METHODS: The material is based on a review of results of international comparative cause-of-death studies and on specific inquiries among EC. Both cause-of-death certification and codification practices are analysed. Certification is studied comparing the models of death certificates, the type of information captured, certifiers training and querying practices. The different coding systems are analysed (International classification of diseases (ICD) in use, interpretation of the ICD rules, implementation of automated coding systems). RESULTS: International studies on comparability of certification and coding practices between countries are rare. These studies are based on certification of cases histories and recoding of samples of death certificates. Recent studies on respiratory diseases, cancers and diabetes outline differences that influenced on the reported level of mortality. The specific EUROSTAT investigation (1997) outline general discrepancies: models of death certificates, nature and amount of information entered, way to establish the diagnosis, degree of consistency of the certification process, autopsy practices, certifiers practices, implementation of ICD-10 and implementation of automated coding systems. CONCLUSION: EUROSTAT studies are now focused on causes of death requiring special attention for comparability (e.g. suicide, accidental deaths, drug and alcohol related deaths, unknown and ill-defined causes), on procedures to improve the homogeneity of certifiers training and querying practices, on the effect of the transition to ICD-10. The international model of death certificate recommended by the World Health Organization should be adopted as widely as possible. Uniform complementary information (e.g. surgery, pregnancy, autopsy, place of occurrence of accidental deaths, work accident) should also be adopted. The EUROSTAT investigations must result in definitions of common recommendations and guidelines to EC.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Electronic health records can be used to create high-quality databases if data are structured and well-registered, which is the case for most perioperative data in the Capital and Zealand Regions of Denmark. We present the purpose and development of the AI and Automation in Anaesthesia (TRIPLE-A) database-a platform designed for epidemiology, prediction, quality control, and automated research data collection. METHODS: Data collection from the electronic medical record (EPIC Systems Corporation, WI, USA) was approved by the Capital Region, Denmark, and ethical approval was waived. The first TRIPLE-A database version included surgical procedures performed in a public hospital in the Capital and Zealand Regions of Denmark from 2017 to 2024 without age restrictions. We received structured, timestamped raw data including event log, medicine administrations, blood samples, vital parameters, etc. In collaboration with surgical specialists, we classified surgical procedures based on procedure codes and names. Variables were coded and enriched using multiple data sources (e.g., acute kidney injury: increase in creatinine OR new dialysis or ICD-10 codes) to improve quality and mirror the clinical reasoning of physicians. Variable coding, validation and improvement continuous in iterative processes with each project in the database. The database is scheduled for updates every 6 months and as needed, currently approved to December 2030 with plans for future extension. The database is used for multiple purposes in research with broad collaboration. RESULTS: The first version of the TRIPLE-A database consists of 1,142,108 surgeries in 675,790 patients. Data were processed into 17 summary tables (anaesthesia, airway management, complications, etc.) including a total of 1617 variables. The database currently provides data for 34 research projects. CONCLUSION: TRIPLE-A is a continuously updated, granular, high-quality perioperative database. It will be used for (1) high-quality epidemiological research, (2) automated data retrieval into case report forms in cohort studies and randomized trials, (3) monitoring and evaluation of clinical implementation of interventions, and (4) development of perioperative prediction models for risk stratification and individualized treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the emergency department using an electrocardiogram (ECG) may optimize acute heart failure (AHF) management. We aimed to assess the efficacy of 527 automated 12‑lead ECG features for estimating LVEF among patients with AHF. METHOD: Medical records of patients >18 years old and AHF-related ICD codes, demographics, LVEF %, comorbidities, and medication were analyzed. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) identified important ECG features and evaluated performance. RESULTS: Among 851 patients, the mean age was 74 years (IQR:11), male 56 % (n = 478), and the median body mass index was 29 kg/m CONCLUSIONS: An explainable machine learning model with physiologically feasible predictors may help screen patients with low LVEF in AHF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The medical problem list is an important part of the electronic medical record in development in our institution. To serve the functions it is designed for, the problem list has to be as accurate and timely as possible. However, the current problem list is usually incomplete and inaccurate, and is often totally unused. To alleviate this issue, we are building an environment where the problem list can be easily and effectively maintained. METHODS: For this project, 80 medical problems were selected for their frequency of use in our future clinical field of evaluation (cardiovascular). We have developed an Automated Problem List system composed of two main components: a background and a foreground application. The background application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to harvest potential problem list entries from the list of 80 targeted problems detected in the multiple free-text electronic documents available in our electronic medical record. These proposed medical problems drive the foreground application designed for management of the problem list. Within this application, the extracted problems are proposed to the physicians for addition to the official problem list. RESULTS: The set of 80 targeted medical problems selected for this project covered about 5% of all possible diagnoses coded in ICD-9-CM in our study population (cardiovascular adult inpatients), but about 64% of all instances of these coded diagnoses. The system contains algorithms to detect first document sections, then sentences within these sections, and finally potential problems within the sentences. The initial evaluation of the section and sentence detection algorithms demonstrated a sensitivity and positive predictive value of 100% when detecting sections, and a sensitivity of 89% and a positive predictive value of 94% when detecting sentences. CONCLUSION: The global aim of our project is to automate the process of creating and maintaining a problem list for hospitalized patients and thereby help to guarantee the timeliness, accuracy and completeness of this information.

Hysterectomies were categorized according to surgical approach: abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal/total laparoscopic, and robotic. Each hysterectomy was also categorized according to primary preoperative diagnosis as general gynecology, gynecologic oncology, and urogynecology. The rates and numbers of hysterectomies performed during 2005-2006 (2 years before acquisition of the robot), 2007-2008 (first 2 years with the robot), and 2009-2011 (3-5 years after acquiring the robot) were compared using χ(2) tests and analysis of variance. The numbers of hysterectomies reported in resident case logs were also collected and compared. A total of 5894 hysterectomies were performed between 2005 and 2011. The total number of hysterectomies performed at Hospital A, which acquired the robotic surgical system, increased over time (p = .04) but remained stable at Hospital B, which did not acquire the robotic surgical system. At Hospital A, the number of robotic hysterectomies increased as the number of abdominal hysterectomies decreased (p < .001), a trend consistent across all diagnostic categories. The number of vaginal and laparoscopic hysterectomies remained stable. Resident case logs also reflected a decrease in the number of abdominal hysterectomies (p = .002) and an increase in the number of combined laparoscopic/robotic hysterectomies (p < .001) performed. The total number of hysterectomies performed by residents was unchanged. CONCLUSION: Introduction of the robotic surgical system was associated with significant changes in the numbers and types of hysterectomies performed in both general and subspecialty gynecology. Although abdominal hysterectomies decreased as robotic hysterectomies increased, other hysterectomies did not. These trends mirror reported resident surgical experience and have implications for resident education.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information about the incidence of anaphylaxis from all causes. OBJECTIVE: The objects of this study were (1) to estimate the incidence of anaphylaxis; (2) to explore the range of diagnoses attributed to an anaphylactic episode; and (3) to describe the clinical features of anaphylaxis. METHODS: The study population consisted of children and adolescents enrolled at a health maintenance organization. We identified potential episodes of anaphylaxis occurring between 1991 and 1997 from automated databases and reviewed the medical record to confirm the diagnosis. We reviewed all diagnoses specific for anaphylaxis (eg, ICD-9 995.0, anaphylactic shock) and sampled from among other related diagnoses (eg, ICD-9 995.3, allergy unspecified). Estimation of the incidence of provider-diagnosed anaphylaxis was based on cases confirmed from among the specific diagnosis codes. Description of the clinical features of anaphylaxis involved all confirmed cases regardless of diagnosis. RESULTS: We identified 67 episodes of anaphylaxis among children with diagnosis codes specific for anaphylaxis (10.5 episodes per 100,000 person-years). There was no increase in incidence over time. Review of samples of diagnoses not specific for anaphylaxis yielded an additional 18 episodes. Among all identified episodes (n = 85), mucocutaneous and respiratory manifestations were the most common. Seventy-one percent of episodes were treated in the emergency department. Nine episodes (11%) resulted in hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of anaphylaxis did not increase during these years. A majority of episodes were treated in the emergency department. Anaphylaxis in this population was frequently diagnosed as another related condition, and the basis and implications of diagnostic practices in this disorder warrant further exploration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Efficient methods are needed to monitor infections associated with long-term central venous catheters (CVCs) in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Automated medical records and claims data have been used for surveillance of these infections without evaluation of their accuracy or validity. OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of using electronic records to identify CVC placement and design a system for identifying CVC-associated infections. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort study at an HMO and two teaching hospitals in Boston, one adult (hospital A) and one pediatric (hospital B), between January 1991 and December 1997. Tunneled catheters, totally implanted catheters, and hemodialysis catheters were examined. Claims databases of both the HMO and the hospitals were searched for 10 CPT codes, 2 ICD-9 codes, and internal charge codes indicating CVC insertion. Lists were compared with each other and with medical records for correlation and accuracy. PATIENTS: All members of the HMO who had a CVC inserted at one of the two hospitals during the study period. RESULTS: There was wide variation in the CVC insertions identified in each database. Although ICD-9 codes at each hospital and CPT/ICD-9 combinations at the HMO found similar total numbers of CVCs, there was little overlap between the individuals identified (62% for hospital A with HMO and 4% for hospital B). CONCLUSION: Claims data from different sources do not identify the same CVC insertion procedures. Current administrative databases are not ready to be used for electronic surveillance of CVC-associated complications without extensive modification and validation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. METHODS: We analyzed 762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases [ICD] code descriptions, 436 free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer. Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14 predefined categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. RESULTS: BioBERT achieved the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy (81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. CONCLUSIONS: Although current performance levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of miscoding, misclassification, misdiagnosis and under-registration of diabetes mellitus (DM) in primary health care in Catalonia (Spain), and to explore use of automated algorithms to identify them. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, retrospective study using an anonymized electronic general practice database, data were collected from patients or users with a diabetes-related code or from patients with no DM or prediabetes code but treated with antidiabetic drugs (unregistered DM). Decision algorithms were designed to classify the true diagnosis of type 1 DM (T1DM), type 2 DM (T2DM), and undetermined DM (UDM), and to classify unregistered DM patients treated with antidiabetic drugs. RESULTS: Data were collected from a total of 376,278 subjects with a DM ICD-10 code, and from 8707 patients with no DM or prediabetes code but treated with antidiabetic drugs. After application of the algorithms, 13.9% of patients with T1DM were identified as misclassified, and were probably T2DM; 80.9% of patients with UDM were reclassified as T2DM, and 19.1% of them were misdiagnosed as DM when they probably had prediabetes. The overall prevalence of miscoding (multiple codes or UDM) was 2.2%. Finally, 55.2% of subjects with unregistered DM were classified as prediabetes, 35.7% as T2DM, 8.5% as UDM treated with insulin, and 0.6% as T1DM. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of inappropriate codification or classification and under-registration of DM is relevant in primary care. Implementation of algorithms could automatically flag cases that need review and would substantially decrease the risk of inappropriate registration or coding.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Identification of patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction is the first step in identifying which patients may benefit from clinical practice guidelines. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a computerized tool using clinical information that is commonly available to identify patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of patients seen in a Department of Veterans Affairs General Internal Medicine Clinic who had echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography performed as part of their clinical care. RESULTS: We identified 2246 subjects who had at least one cardiac imaging study. A total of 778 (34.6%) subjects met study criteria for LVSD. Subjects with LVSD were slightly older than subjects without LVSD (70 years vs 68 years, P =.00002) but were similar with regard to sex and race. Subjects with LVSD were more likely to have prescriptions for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, carvedilol, digoxin, loop diuretics, hydralazine, nitrates, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Of the variables included in the final predictive model, ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics, and digoxin exerted the greatest predictive power. Discriminant analysis demonstrated that models containing pharmacy information were consistently more accurate (75% accurate [65% sensitivity, 81% specificity]) than those models that contained only International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9), codes, including ICD-9 codes for congestive heart failure (72% accurate [80% sensitivity, 68% specificity]). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that an automated, computer-driven algorithm identifying LVSD permits simple, rapid, and timely identification of patients with congestive heart failure by use of only routinely collected data. Future research is needed to develop accurate electronic identification of heart failure and other common chronic conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of resident case logs has been considered by the Residency Review Committee for Neurology of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). OBJECTIVE: This study explores the effectiveness of a data-mining program for creating resident logs and compares the results to a manual data-entry system. Other potential applications of data mining to enhancing resident education are also explored. DESIGN/METHODS: Patient notes dictated by residents were extracted from the Hospital Information System and analyzed using an unstructured mining program. History, examination and ICD codes were obtained and compared to the existing manual log. The automated data History, examination, and ICD codes were gathered for a 30-day period and compared to manual case logs. RESULTS: The automated method extracted all resident dictations with the dates of encounter and transcription. The automated data-miner processed information from all 19 residents, while only 4 residents logged manually. The manual method identified only broad categories of diseases; the major categories were stroke or vascular disorder 53 (27.6%), epilepsy 28 (14.7%), and pain syndromes 26 (13.5%). In the automated method, epilepsy 114 (21.1%), cerebral atherosclerosis 114 (21.1%), and headache 105 (19.4%) were the most frequent primary diagnoses, and headache 89 (16.5%), seizures 94 (17.4%), and low back pain 47 (9%) were the most common chief complaints. More detailed patient information such as tobacco use 227 (42%), alcohol use 205 (38%), and drug use 38 (7%) were extracted by the data-mining method. CONCLUSIONS: Manual case logs are time-consuming, provide limited information, and may be unpopular with residents. Data mining is a time-effective tool that may aid in the assessment of resident experience or the ACGME core competencies or in resident clinical research. More study of this method in larger numbers of residency programs is needed.

AB  - ICD-9 codes are conventionally used to identify pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) from administrative data for surveillance purposes. This approach may include non-PID cases. To refine PID case identification among women with ICD-9 codes suggestive of PID, a case-finding algorithm was developed using additional variables. Potential PID cases were identified among women aged 15-44 years at Group Health (GH) and Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) and verified by medical record review. A classification and regression tree analysis was used to develop the algorithm at GH; validation occurred at KPCO. The positive predictive value (PPV) for using ICD-9 codes alone to identify clinical PID cases was 79%. The algorithm identified PID appropriate treatment and age 15-25 years as predictors. Algorithm sensitivity (GH = 96.4%; KPCO = 90.3%) and PPV (GH = 86.9%; KPCO = 84.5%) were high, but specificity was poor (GH = 45.9%; KPCO = 37.0%). In GH, the algorithm offered a practical alternative to medical record review to further improve PID case identification.

AB  - Medical language is highly compositional and makes extensive use of common roots, especially Latino-Greek roots. Besides words devoted to common sense, medical language presents some typical characteristics, especially on morphological and semantic aspects of word formation. Morphological decomposition and identification precedes semantic analysis. It is only when these two prerequisites are fulfilled that an attempt to grasp the meaning of a whole expression is made possible. The main aim of the proposed approach is that of coping with 'the lack of coverage of the medical lexical knowledge', in order to help physicians find the correct international classification for diseases (ICD) codes for a written diagnosis. The proposed methodology allows the development of a powerful dynamic dictionary dedicated to natural language processing in the field of diagnoses and narrative procedures. It describes the design of an analyser that can profit from a dictionary. The methods used have proved to be efficient for various classifications, s well as for multiple languages, as the system presently supports French, German, English and Dutch for ICD-9 and ICD-10 classifications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: From July to September 1999, due to a concern of toxicity from exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines, the American Academy of Pediatrics and U.S. Public Health Service temporarily recommended delaying the administration of first dose of hepatitis B vaccine until the age of 2-6 months for infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen negative mothers. Our objectives were to determine whether the recommendation affected the rate of perinatal hepatitis B infection in a multistate managed care population; to describe neonatal and early childhood cases of hepatitis B infection and to evaluate a possible role of the recommendation; and to assess the timeliness, with respect to the U.S. childhood immunization schedule, of vaccinations during the first 2 years of life. METHODS: We identified 3 cohorts of infants born before (July 1998 to June 1999), during (July 1999 to September 1999) and after (October 1999 to September 2000) the recommendation period. We used automated claims data to identify possible neonatal and early childhood hepatitis B cases using specific ICD-9 diagnosis and CPT procedure codes and validated cases through medical record review. Using Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) data, we calculated vaccination coverage for the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at 3-month intervals from January 1999 to September 2000. RESULTS: The eligible populations in the "before," "during" and "after" cohorts were 29,347, 7791 and 29,215 infants, respectively. Of 41 possible hepatitis B cases identified in the 3 cohorts, we confirmed 1 case in the after cohort with medical record review. Despite receiving the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin within 12-24 hours of birth, the infant was diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed chronic hepatitis B at age of 9 months. An analysis of HEDIS data showed that vaccination coverage for the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine was 98% (January to March 1999) and 96% (April to June 1999) for the "before" cohort and 66% for the "during" cohort. For the "after" cohort the coverage was 72% (October to December 1999), 83% (January to March 2000), 91% (April to June 2000) and 95% (July to September 2000). CONCLUSIONS: This study did not identify any perinatal hepatitis B transmission among health plan enrollees associated with the 1999 recommendation. The recommendation did result in a delay of hepatitis B birth dose in the "during" cohort as intended for infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen negative mothers. Six months after the recommendation was rescinded there was still a delay in the timing of first dose of hepatitis B vaccine, but the timing had returned to the prerecommendation level after 9-12 months.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Standardized registries, such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, are commonly built using administrative codes assigned to patient encounters. However, patients with fall injury are often coded using subsequent injury codes, such as hip fractures. This necessitates manual screening to ensure the accuracy of data registries. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to automate the extraction of fall incidents and mechanisms using natural language processing (NLP) and compare this approach with the ICD method. METHODS: Clinical notes for patients with fall-induced hip fractures were retrospectively reviewed by medical experts. Fall incidences were detected, annotated, and classified among patients who had a fall-induced hip fracture (case group). The control group included patients with hip fractures without any evidence of falls. NLP models were developed using the annotated notes of the study groups to fulfill two separate tasks: fall occurrence detection and fall mechanism classification. The performances of the models were compared using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: A total of 1769 clinical notes were included in the final analysis for the fall occurrence task, and 783 clinical notes were analyzed for the fall mechanism classification task. The highest F1-score using NLP for fall occurrence was 0.97 (specificity=0.96; sensitivity=0.97), and for fall mechanism classification was 0.61 (specificity=0.56; sensitivity=0.62). Natural language processing could detect up to 98% of the fall occurrences and 65% of the fall mechanisms accurately, compared to 26% and 12%, respectively, by ICD codes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed promising performance with higher accuracy of NLP algorithms compared to the conventional method for detecting fall occurrence and mechanism in developing disease registries using clinical notes. Our approach can be introduced to other registries that are based on large data and are in need of accurate annotation and classification.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Navigation and robotic technologies emerge as alternatives to conventional freehand techniques for spine fusion. They aim to enhance perioperative and postoperative outcomes, yet their effectiveness remains limited by small cohort sizes in existing literature. Our study compares navigation and robotic technologies in lumbar fusion surgery across complications, costs, and mortality. METHODS: This study employed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. The NIS annually captures approximately 7 million unweighted admissions. The dataset spanned 2016 to 2019, comprising 58,270 patients. Exclusions included non-elective admissions, pre-admission surgeries, and cases reporting $0 hospital costs. Validation of comorbidities and complications was conducted using ICD-10 codes. Analytical techniques, such as trend identification and statistical analyses, were applied with a significance threshold of p  < 0.05. Demographic and clinical characteristics, surgery types, and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Navigation-guided surgeries dominated (86.7% in 2016, 77.1% in 2019), while Robotic-assisted surgeries increased steadily. Both showed minimal mortality rates. Navigation-guided surgeries had lower charges, lower risks of blood loss anemia, acute kidney injury, and blood transfusion compared to Robotic-assisted surgeries. Navigation-guided surgeries showed significantly lower risks of complications in one level lumbar fusion of vertebral joint and fusion of lumbosacral joint compared to Robotic-Assisted procedures. Additionally, Robotic-Assisted surgeries present higher risks across blood loss anemia, acute kidney injury, and blood transfusion, with risk ratios ranging from 1.24 to 1.72 times higher. CONCLUSION: This study highlights shifting trends in lumbar fusion surgeries, underscoring the need for tailored approaches and nuanced clinical considerations to improve patient outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although the framework of the episode of care offers much promise in examining the process of primary health care, the development of episode-oriented, automated data sources has proceeded slowly. Experience with the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) in the European Community has confirmed its usefulness in creating and analyzing episodes of care, but it has seen little use in the United States. We describe the development of a Primary Care Information System (PCIS), which employs ICPC to create episodes of care from routinely collected clinical data. METHODS: The PCIS is a partially computerized medical information system running on a standard Macintosh microcomputer. The PCIS integrates ICPC, ICD-9-CM, and CPT-4 coding structures to provide episode-oriented data for clinical, administrative, research, and reimbursement needs. The performance of the PCIS was assessed based on five major issues: clinician cooperation, data-entry accuracy, validity of episode data, cost, and perceived value to users. RESULTS: The data collection and entry process required minimal additional effort from clinicians and data-entry personnel, and data-entry accuracy exceeded published estimates for other primary care data sources. Data management costs of about $1 per encounter compare favorably to published estimates for other office-based clinical information systems. The major problem seen during pilot testing was inaccurate tracking of episode boundaries through changes in providers and consequent changes in labels for problems and diagnoses. This problem has been addressed in development of the second-generation PCIS. CONCLUSION: The combination of an episode-oriented framework such as ICPC and a flexible medical information system provides a promising platform for the study of the content and process of primary health care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotyping underpins genome-wide association studies, yet current ICD-code phenotypes rely heavily on manually curated lists such as Phecodes. These definitions are labour-intensive to maintain, inherently subjective, and may omit clinically relevant diagnostic codes, reducing study power. Advances in text embedding models offer an opportunity to automate and standardize ICD-based phenotype construction. METHODS: We developed Phecoder, an ensemble of pre-trained text embedding models that rank ICD codes by similarity from free-text phenotype descriptions. Nine embedding models and multiple unsupervised ensemble rank-fusion methods were evaluated against 1,125 PhecodeX phenotypes. Retrieval performance was assessed using recall and average precision at top-100 (R@100, AP@100). Expert clinical review of six neuropsychiatric phenotypes was undertaken to identify relevant ICD codes absent from PhecodeX. Cohort sizes under these new definitions were compared with PhecodeX across sex and ancestry strata in the Million Veteran Program (MVP). FINDINGS: Among individual models, Qwen3-Embedding-4B achieved the highest median recall (R@100 = 0.86). Ensemble rank-fusion further improved R@100 by 3%, and median AP@100 by 8%. Expert review confirmed that Phecoder retrieved additional clinically relevant ICD codes beyond PhecodeX across all six neuropsychiatric case studies. Median potential case expansion increased by 200%, with 700% increases for bipolar disorder and 2000% increase for eating disorders. INTERPRETATION: Manually defining ICD phenotypes has been critiqued as subjective, potentially yielding overly restrictive definitions that miss relevant codes. To address this issue, Phecoder algorithmically identifies relevant codes for ICD-based phenotyping. Phecoder extracts relevant ICD codes to expand the potential case pool across different demographic groups. Phecoder is easily applicable to future ICD-code releases and across different ICD coding versions that are used in different countries. Taken together, Phecoder has the potential to improve reproducibility in EHR data research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare direct in-hospital costs and short-term outcomes of para-aortic lymph node dissection (PAL) for gynecologic cancer performed by open laparotomy (OLP), conventional laparoscopy (CLS) and robot-assisted surgery (RAS) in a nationwide French cohort, using a tertiary robotic unit as benchmark. METHODS: The 2023 national hospital registry (PMSI) was filtered for admissions in public and not-for-profit hospitals coded for uterine cancer or ovarian cancer (ICD-10) combined with PAL; pelvic dissection was additionally recorded when the corresponding code was present. Aggregate data (admissions, ward and intensive-care unit bed-days, Severity Index (SI) class) were extracted by surgical approach. Direct hospital costs were calculated by combining national tariffs with approach-specific disposable-instrument charges. The primary endpoint was the direct index-stay cost; secondary endpoints included length of stay (LOS) and severe morbidity (SI 3-4). Design was retrospective and based on approach-level aggregates (no patient-level covariates); administrative-coding constraints were present, and comparative results were interpreted accordingly. RESULTS: Among the 1 076 patients who underwent PAL in 2023, the surgical approach was OLP in 69.7% (n = 750), CLS in 20.2% (n = 217), and robot-assisted surgery (RAS) in 10.1% (n = 109). Of these, 30 RAS procedures were performed at Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou (RAS-HEGP). Median LOS for uncomplicated cases was 7.3 (OLP), 3.3 (CLS), 3.2 (RAS-PUB) and 4.5 (RAS-HEGP) days, respectively (p < 0.001). Severe morbidity fell from 33.1% (OLP) to 6.0% (CLS), 8.9% (RAS-PUB) and 3.3% (RAS-HEGP). Mean direct costs were €8 823, €3 222, €4 099 and €3 962. Adjusted odds of severe morbidity dropped by 87% with CLS, 80% with RAS-PUB and 93% with RAS-HEGP; cost ratios relative to OLP were 0.37 for CLS, 0.46 for RAS-PUB and 0.45 for RAS-HEGP (all p < 0.001). All between-approach comparisons are descriptive; p values are exploratory. CONCLUSIONS: OLP remains predominant yet is clinically and economically inferior. CLS offers the best value where expertise exists, while RAS approximates CLS and markedly outperforms OLP, supporting its use as an alternative to OLP in centres that cannot sustain complex laparoscopy.

AB  - Since 1. 1. 1985, computer-aided basic medical documentation has been routine at the University Orthopedic Clinic in Friedrichsheim, near Frankfurt. In addition to data on patient's histories, all data needed to satisfy the criteria of the Federal Directive on Operating Cost Rates are gathered. The diagnoses are stored in clear text, in a modified Eichler code, and according to ICD 9. Conversion from the Eichler code to ICD 9 is almost fully automated. In a study covering 100 hospitalized cases the following findings were obtained relating to sources of error and reliability: Without any additional in-house plausibility checks, the rate of error in the ID code, created by coding family name, date of birth, and sex, was 7%. In clear text all diagnoses except one and all forms of therapy were correctly reproduced as contained in the medical report. On the other hand, 7% of the conversions into the Eichler code contained errors. The reason for the difference in the quality of data is pointed out. In some of the other surveys, e.g., of infection rates, the rates of error were very high; most errors had been caused by the ward physicians. Data quality is enhanced by exploitation of routine process data when these control administrative procedures or are used for communication between physicians, since they then become relevant to actions and decisions and hence have to be reliable, regardless of documentation purposes.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with liver failure experience long hospitalizations and acute neurologic complications. Encephalopathy limits the bedside examination, rendering presenting signs of acute brain injury less specific. Seizures are common. Brain MRI is the gold standard for detecting acute brain injury, but intensive medical needs may preclude immediate transfer for imaging. EEG is a bedside test applied in cases of seizure or encephalopathy. We hypothesized that EEG variables can predict MRI signs of acute brain injury in children hospitalized with liver failure. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis, records were collected for patients admitted to a MedStar hospital between 2014 and 2022 with ICD-9/10 codes related to liver failure, who underwent brain MRI and EEG testing during the same admission. Exclusion criteria included age older than 24 years and >7 days elapsing between EEG and MRI testing. Clinical data of interest from chart review, reinterpreted MRI scans, reinterpreted EEG tracings, and quantitative EEG variables were compiled into a database. Quantitative EEG variables were processed using MNE-Python. RESULTS: Of 746 records screened, 52 patients met inclusion criteria comprising 63 EEG-MRI pairs. Univariate analysis of all quantitative EEG variables of interest showed depressed theta-alpha variability (TAV) when paired MRI involved abnormal restricted diffusivity in cortical or deep gray matter structures (TAV 0.705, SD 0.310;  DISCUSSION: Depressed TAV on EEG is associated with increased odds of abnormal restricted diffusivity in gray matter on brain MRI in children and young adults hospitalized with liver failure. This MRI finding is seen in scenarios where changes to medical management are time-sensitive (i.e., acute stroke and PRES) or where prognostic discussion may be influenced by MRI findings (hypoxic-ischemic injury). TAV thus has a potential role as an automated, bedside decision support tool for clinicians deciding on the urgency of brain MRI in critically ill patients.

AB  - The study of trauma has been handicapped from its inception by the absence of a single coherent method of cataloging injuries. The AIS and ICD-9 systems have failed to fill this void because they lack the precision necessary to describe surgically treated injuries. We conceived a simple system of injury description in which injuries are rapidly encoded using a microcomputer in sufficient detail to distinguish among millions of different injuries. This system is easily searched by a microcomputer and allows for the automatic assignment of AIS, ISS, and CPT codes. In this system a patient is described by a 'paragraph' consisting of any number of identically patterned 'sentences,' each describing one of the patient's injuries. Each 'sentence' is composed of a string of six 'words' from controlled vocabularies and has the following structure: "Body region, Organ, Anatomic region, Injury, Physiology, Treatment." Defining the vocabulary allowed for each 'word' in a 'sentence' is complex because the allowed vocabulary is dependent upon the preceding 'words' in a 'sentence,' but in practice a microcomputer simply provides short lists of acceptable choices at each step of injury description, and records the user's selections. Additionally, the microcomputer assigns AIS, ISS, and CPT codes appropriate to the injury description sentence. The ease of data entry, the fineness of detail captured, the automation of code assignment, and the accuracy of database searching for specific injuries, classes of injuries, or combinations of injuries, we believe will give this approach widespread application in academic trauma centers where an accurate and accessible trauma database is important.

AB  - Methods for surveillance of adverse events (AEs) in clinical settings are limited by cost, technology, and appropriate data availability. In this study, two methods for semi-automated review of text records within the Veterans Administration database are utilized to identify AEs related to the placement of central venous catheters (CVCs): a Natural Language Processing program and a phrase-matching algorithm. A sample of manually reviewed records were then compared to the results of both methods to assess sensitivity and specificity. The phrase-matching algorithm was found to be a sensitive but relatively non-specific method, whereas a natural language processing system was significantly more specific but less sensitive. Positive predictive values for each method estimated the CVC-associated AE rate at this institution to be 6.4 and 6.2%, respectively. Using both methods together results in acceptable sensitivity and specificity (72.0 and 80.1%, respectively). All methods including manual chart review are limited by incomplete or inaccurate clinician documentation. A secondary finding was related to the completeness of administrative data (ICD-9 and CPT codes) used to identify intensive care unit patients in whom a CVC was placed. Administrative data identified less than 11% of patients who had a CVC placed. This suggests that other methods, including automated methods such as phrase matching, may be more sensitive than administrative data in identifying patients with devices. Considerable potential exists for the use of such methods for the identification of patients at risk, AE surveillance, and prevention of AEs through decision support technologies.

AB  - We report on the design and evaluation of an original system to help assignment ICD (International Classification of Disease) codes to clinical narratives. The task is defined as a multi-class multi-document classification task. We combine a set of machine learning and data-poor methods to generate a single automatic text categorizer, which returns a ranked list of ICD codes. The combined ranking system currently obtains a precision of 75% at high ranks and a recall of about 63% for the top twenty returned codes for a theoretical upper bound of about 79% (inter-coder agreement). The performance of the data-poor classifier is weak, whereas the use of tempo-rally-typed contents such as anamnesis and prescription free text sections results in a statistically significant improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Syndromic surveillance in emergency departments (EDs) may be used to deliver early warnings of increases in disease activity, to provide situational awareness during events of public health significance, to supplement other information on trends in acute disease and injury, and to support the development and monitoring of prevention or response strategies. Changes in mental health related ED presentations may be relevant to these goals, provided they can be identified accurately and efficiently. This study aimed to measure the accuracy of using diagnostic codes in electronic ED presentation records to identify mental health-related visits. METHODS: We selected a random sample of 500 records from a total of 1,815,588 ED electronic presentation records from 59 NSW public hospitals during 2010. ED diagnoses were recorded using any of ICD-9, ICD-10 or SNOMED CT classifications. Three clinicians, blinded to the automatically generated syndromic grouping and each other's classification, reviewed the triage notes and classified each of the 500 visits as mental health-related or not. A "mental health problem presentation" for the purposes of this study was defined as any ED presentation where either a mental disorder or a mental health problem was the reason for the ED visit. The combined clinicians' assessment of the records was used as reference standard to measure the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the automatic classification of coded emergency department diagnoses. Agreement between the reference standard and the automated coded classification was estimated using the Kappa statistic. RESULTS: Agreement between clinician's classification and automated coded classification was substantial (Kappa = 0.73. 95% CI: 0.58 - 0.87). The automatic syndromic grouping of coded ED diagnoses for mental health-related visits was found to be moderately sensitive (68% 95% CI: 46%-84%) and highly specific at 99% (95% CI: 98%-99.7%) when compared with the reference standard in identifying mental health related ED visits. Positive predictive value was 81% (95% CI: 0.57 - 0.94) and negative predictive value was 98% (95% CI: 0.97-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Mental health presentations identified using diagnoses coded with various classifications in electronic ED presentation records offers sufficient accuracy for application in near real-time syndromic surveillance.

AB  - UNLABELLED: In women age 45 years and older, enrolled in an integrated group practice in 2007, use of ICD9 diagnostic codes, including the "not otherwise specified" code (821.00) resulted in a high false-positive rate for identifying femoral diaphyseal fractures. Restriction to more specific site-codes missed 36% of these rare fractures. INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the utility of automated data in identifying the occurrence of femoral diaphyseal fractures. METHODS: We identified all women age 45 years and older enrolled in a Pacific Northwest integrated group practice during 2007. Using the computerized database we selected all ICD9 codes that could be related to a femur fracture occurring in the diaphyseal region. We then quantified the percent of codes confirmed by medical record review to have occurred in the correct anatomic location during the year of interest (positive predictive value). RESULTS: Of the 95,765 eligible women, 161 (0.17%) had an ICD9 diagnostic code potentially related to a femoral diaphyseal fracture in 2007; of these 58 (36%) had a fracture of the femoral diaphysis, and 38 (24%) of the fractures occurred in 2007. The most frequent code was 821.00, described as "femur fracture not otherwise specified", applied to 107 women; 21 of the 58 diaphyseal fractures had this code. CONCLUSION: In this study, use of ICD9 codes that included the "not otherwise specified" code (821.00) resulted in a high false-positive rate for identifying diaphyseal fractures. However, restriction to more specific site codes would have missed at least 36% of the diaphyseal fractures. Furthermore, the codes did not provide any information about the characteristics of the fracture. Our findings support validating cases selected using ICD codes before they are used as a surrogate for the occurrence of femoral diaphyseal fractures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite the rapid proliferation of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), little attention has been paid to patient utilisation of this newest surgical innovation and barriers that may result in disparities in access to RARP. The goal of this study is to identify demographic and economic factors that decrease the likelihood of patients with prostate cancer (PC) receiving RARP. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective, pooled, cross-sectional study was conducted using 2009-2011 California State Inpatient Data and American Hospital Association data. Patients who were diagnosed with PC and underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) from 225 hospitals in California were identified, using ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' likelihood of receiving RARP was associated with patient and hospital characteristics using the two models: (1) between-hospital and (2) within-hospital models. Multivariate binomial logistic regression was used for both models. The first model predicted patient access to RARP-performing hospitals versus non-RARP-performing hospitals, after adjusting for patient and hospital-level covariates (between-hospital variation). The second model examined the likelihood of patients receiving RARP within RARP-performing hospitals (within-hospital variation). RESULTS: Among 20,411 patients who received RP, 13,750 (67.4%) received RARP, while 6661 (32.6%) received non-RARP. This study found significant differences in access to RARP-performing hospitals when race/ethnicity, income and insurance status were compared, after controlling for selected confounding factors (all p<0.001). For example, Hispanic, Medicare and Medicaid patients were more likely to be treated at non-RARP-performing hospitals versus RARP-performing hospitals. Within RARP-performing hospitals, Medicaid patients had 58% lower odds of receiving RARP versus non-RARP (adjusted OR 0.42, p<0.001). However, there were no significant differences by race/ethnicity or income within RARP-performing hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences exist by race/ethnicity and payer status in accessing RARP-performing hospitals. Furthermore, payer status continues to be an important predictor of receiving RARP within RARP-performing hospitals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The U.S. military leadership has recently increased its efforts to reduce the number of lost-workday injuries for both the active duty and civilian employee components of the total force. The detailed causes and circumstances of those nonfatal injuries-information needed for injury prevention-has largely been unexplored. The purpose of this project was to determine the utility of Air Force safety data for nonfatal injury prevention. METHODS: In 2004, events associated with injury-producing mishaps reported through the U.S. Air Force (USAF) Ground Safety Automated System from 1993-2002 (n = 32,812 injuries) were reconstructed. Essential data elements necessary to reconstruct event causes and circumstances were identified in both coded data and in free-text mishap narratives. Activities and mechanisms were coded in a format similar to that of the ICD-10. A taxonomy was then developed to identify hazard scenarios associated with injury-producing activities or mechanisms. RESULTS: Coded data provided only four data elements (activity, injury event/exposure, nature of injury/body part, and outcome) that were sufficiently descriptive for prevention purposes. Therefore, narrative information was coded and analyzed to obtain additional information. The assembled data enabled identification and description of hazard scenarios associated with the most common injury-producing activities and mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Safety reports from the USAF provide detailed mishap descriptions for lost-workday injuries that could support in-depth analysis and more effective preventive efforts. However, some of the most valuable information is found in the pre-text narratives that require coding and classification, such as was conducted for this report in order to be optimally useful for injury epidemiology and prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the demographic, medical and forensic aspects of patients who were bitten by cats or dogs and admitted to the Eskişehir Osmangazi University, Education, Training and Research Hospital. METHODS: All the medical records of the last five years inside the automation system of the hospital were investigated. One hundred sixty-seven cases were included according to their ICD-10 diagnostic codes. On statistical evaluation, frequency and chi-square analyses were conducted and SPSS 13.0 program was used. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen patients were bitten by dogs, whereas 46 patients were bitten by cats. Most of the victims were children. 51.9% of the bites were on an upper extremity, and 29.1% were on a lower extremity. Although cat and dog bites demonstrate seasonal changes, summer months were found important, when children were on holidays. Hyperemia, scratch and laceration were the most frequent diagnoses after injury. The length of hospital stay was between 1-22 days and calculated as a mean 7.3±5.8 days. CONCLUSION: Dog and cat bites are very well known public health issues in our country. To know animals and their needs and to respect them should be the priority of families to avoid unexpected injury. Families should teach their children to treat dogs and cats with respect, to avoid direct eye contact with the animals and not to annoy them.

AB  - Mortality statistics are of crucial importance to epidemiological research. Sources of mortality data in Egypt are many. The first records are hospital records, which submit its data to health office records and lastly civil register office records. Hospital records include hospital death notification certificate and hospital mortician register. Health office records include mortality register, death certificate and death notification report to civil register office. The latter is designed to have a coded data and cause of death according to ICD-10. It is supposed that the death notification report that originates from the hospital is the source of data for the rest of records and registers. So, all these data for the same dead person must be the same. Quality of the original data will reflect itself on the rest of data. This study aims at establishment and assessment of automated system for management of mortality data at (hospital 1, affiliated to Ministry of Scientific Research) and comparing this system and its output with another one (hospital 2, affiliated to the Ministry of Health). The tools of this study are review of the above mentioned records and registers and personal interviews. Death certificate itself is not reviewed, as it is not found in the health office. One-year data sample was chosen for the study. Development of the system at hospital 1 is based on system analysis, design, implementation, and evaluation. Results showed that automated system of hospital1 have the values of automation as timely retrieval and decreasing the error of transcription. Epi-Info software package gives easy statistical analysis and the potential for record linkage. Comparison between hospital death notification certificate that originated from the hospital and health office register showed 97.4% matching for words or expressions in hospital 1 and 50.0% in hospital 2. Comparing hospital death notification report with that originated from health office to related civil office, showed 100.0% matching for hospital1 and 86.7% for hospital 2. As regards correctness of reporting the cause of death, 97.4% of deaths in hospital1, and 29.9% in hospital 2 showed non-specific cause of death reported as circulatory and respiratory distress, that is the actual cause of death is not reported. It is concluded that, unification and automation of the systems is a requirement. Record linkage between different locations of mortality data is recommended. Training on reporting and coding the cause of death is also recommended.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Data stored in Healthcare Information Systems correspond potentially to a vast source of information for supporting decisions in management or public health issues. The presented study illustrates clinical data valuation, through the analysis of clinical pathways of elderly patients at the Emergency Department (ED) of Rennes hospital. METHOD: Relevant data were extracted from the Emergency Department database. Several analysis (e.g., cusum method) and representation tools (e.g., Graphviz) were used to study the patients' pathways, the dynamics of flows and the patients' characteristics. RESULTS: 4951 admissions were analysed and visualized. The representations provided a synthetic, global and comprehensive view of the department activities, to the satisfaction of the clinicians. Limitations of the ICD-10 coding of the diagnoses at the ED were pointed out as well as syntax and semantic interoperability issues. A solution is proposed for automating and scaling the Decision Support System.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ngram classifier is created by using text fragments to measure associations between chief complaints (CC) and a syndromic grouping of ICD-9-CM codes. OBJECTIVES: For gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome to determine: (1) ngram CC classifier sensitivity/specificity. (2) Daily volumes for ngram CC and ICD-9-CM classifiers. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: 19 Emergency Departments. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive visits (1/1/2000-12/31/2005). PROTOCOL: (1) Used an existing ICD-9-CM filter for "lower GI" to create the ngram CC classifier from a training set and then measured sensitivity/specificity in a test set using an ICD-9-CM classifier as criterion. (2) Compare daily volumes based on ICD-9-CM with that predicted by the ngram classifier. RESULTS: For a specificity of 0.96, sensitivity was 0.70. The daily volume correlation for ngram vs. ICD-9-CM was R=0.92. CONCLUSION: The ngram CC classifier performed similarly to manually developed CC classifiers and has advantages of rapid automated creation and updating, and may be used independent of language or dialect.

AB  - EHR-based phenotype development and validation are extremely time-consuming and have considerable monetary cost. The creation of a phenotype currently requires clinical experts and experts in the data to be queried. The new approach presented here demonstrates a computational alternative to the classification of patient cohorts based on automatic weighting of ICD codes. This approach was applied to data from six different clinics within the University of Arkansas for Medical Science (UAMS) health system. The results were compared with phenotype algorithms designed by clinicians and informaticians for asthma and melanoma. Relative to traditional phenotype development, this method shows potential to considerably reduce time requirements and monetary costs with comparable results.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Factors influencing pyeloplasty surgical admission costs are not well understood. Our objectives were to (1) measure the relationship between pediatric pyeloplasty surgical volume and admission costs and (2) identify hospital, surgical, and patient factors associated with costs and length of stay (LOS) for pyeloplasty admission. METHODS: We queried the Pediatric Health Information System multicenter billing database from 2012 to 2021 for patients aged younger than 18 who underwent open or robotic pyeloplasty based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9, ICD-10, or Current Procedural Terminology codes. We tested the relationship between hospital-level pyeloplasty volume and total estimated resource-utilization costs for pyeloplasty admission using Spearman's correlation. We used generalized linear models with generalized estimating equations to obtain the adjusted association between each factor and total costs (log-gamma model) and LOS (negative binomial distribution). We report risk ratios and incidence rate ratios with robust variance estimates and 95% CI for the effects on total costs and LOS, respectively. RESULTS: Of 13,233 patients undergoing pyeloplasty with a mean (SD) age of 6.6 (5.4) years, 5462 (41%) had robotic surgery. There was a small negative correlation between pyeloplasty volume and total admission costs (r = -0.017,  CONCLUSIONS: Higher pyeloplasty volume has a small correlation with lower total pyeloplasty admission costs. However, medical and social factors seem to be more closely related to admission costs and LOS than hospital volume or surgical approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether routine laboratory data can improve the ability to compare risk-adjusted outcomes of different medical wards, and to detect 'outlier' wards with significantly better or worse outcome. METHODS: Patient data were taken from the Combined Patient Database Systematic Management and Research Tool, a database created by merging different computerized sources at a tertiary care hospital. All patients admitted to internal wards with the diagnosis of pneumonia during the years 1991-1995 were included (n = 2734). The outcome variable was mortality 30 days post-admission. We used three comorbidity measures based on ICD-9-CM codes as possible predictors of mortality: secondary diagnoses; the Health Care Financing Administration severity index; and the Charlson comorbidity index. Models were created using logistic regression. To each model, laboratory data gathered in the first 48 hours after admission were added. To identify 'outlier' services we determined whether the patients' ward was an independent predictor of mortality. The area under the receiver operator curve (ROC) of the models was used for comparisons. RESULTS: The area under the ROC was 0.65-0.72 for the models based on age and comorbid diagnoses. The addition of laboratory data improved markedly the discriminatory ability of each of the models, as reflected by an increase in the area under the ROC to 0.83-0.84. An 'outlier' ward with a higher risk-adjusted mortality rate was identified only by the models that included laboratory data. CONCLUSION: Basic, automated, routinely gathered laboratory data added significantly to the discriminatory power of risk models based on administrative data with abstracted diagnoses. Addition of laboratory data improved the ability to identify providers with possible exceptional quality of care.

AB  - PURPOSE: Together, the sophisticated computerized information systems and defined, stable populations within Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) can reduce imprecision associated with modeling disease incidence and prevalence. Such data are useful for resource allocation, intervention planning, epidemiological study and surveillance. Identifying all cases of illness within such a defined population is vital to these aims, yet detailed diagnostic information is lacking in many pre-paid plans. In this presentation, diagnostic and prescription data are compared for their ability to assess the treatment prevalence for 28 chronic medical conditions.METHODS: Group Health Cooperative is a mixed model HMO in Western WA state. Automated records for calendar year 1999 were examined for 182,174 commercially insured patients age 20-64. Prescription drug data and International Classification of Disease-9(th) Clinical Modification codes (ICD-9CM) were used to identify 28 chronic medical conditions among patients. Chi square tests were performed to compare results produced by the two methods.RESULTS: The diagnostic method worked best for conditions with no clear pharmacologic treatment. However, the pharmacy-based method better identified patients with chronic illnesses initially diagnosed prior to 1999, and with disorders for which standard diagnostic codes are inconsistently utilized, such as mental health conditions.CONCLUSIONS: While both diagnostic and pharmacy-based methods perform well in identifying a limited set of conditions, each performs poorly under certain circumstances. A hybrid method utilizing both diagnostic and pharmacy data may be more appropriate for an HMO setting. Additional research is needed to develop and refine such a method.

AB  - Since the end of the seventies a great change of edp-use in gynecological private practice took place. Many applications (for example ICD-coding) are not feasible in short time. In medicine, the electronic data processing is not as practicable as the technical progress permits. In only a few programs we can find gynecological specific electronic data processing solutions, networks between private practices, hospitals and Internet access. It is necessary to claim edp-solutions for gynecological private practice and define standards for programming electronic data processing in medicine.

AB  - A system has been developed which allows for easy storage and retrieval of patient diagnoses using ICD-9-CM codes. Entered codes are automatically interpreted by the computer and then both the code and the interpretation are stored as in integral part of the patient record. Teaching clinicians may use an automated, keyword-search algorithm to display the code for a diagnosis of interest and then use that code to find any hospitalized patient with such a primary or secondary diagnosis. Entered diagnoses automatically appear on worksheets in the clinical laboratory. Retrospective studies also may be performed whenever a pathologist wants to compare diagnoses with laboratory results.
